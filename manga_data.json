But the wish also has other unexpected side effects - such as when Keiichi and Belldandy are in peril of being separated, a motorcycle is suddenly repaired so that they can travel together.\n\r\n(Source: Dark Horse)", "Image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/manga/2/58483.jpg"}, "y": 208.04283142089844, "x": 252.22410583496094, "id": "446", "size": 1.0}, {"color": "rgb(172,244,128)", "label": "Silver Diamond", "attributes": {"Score": 8.39, "Rank": "#241", "Popularity": "#1452", "Members": "5,813", "Genres": "Adventure, Fantasy, Shoujo, Shounen Ai", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/manga/1208\">Silver Diamond</a>", "Synopsis": "Sawa Rakan is a normal high school student living a quiet life alone, tending to his many lush plants.

Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle\u2014though nonetheless startling\u2014turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a na\u00efve boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.\n\r\nAs his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/manga/3/164420.jpg"}, "y": -267.8455505371094, "x": -116.11304473876953, "id": "4632", "size": 4.665798187255859}, {"color": "rgb(208,192,221)", "label": "Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi", "attributes": {"Score": 8.21, "Rank": "#497", "Popularity": "#98", "Members": "47,184", "Genres": "Action, Comedy, Drama, Ecchi, Martial Arts, Shounen", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/manga/988\">Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi</a>", "Synopsis": "The story is focused on Kenichi Shirahama, an average 15-year-old weakling, whose life turns to Hell with the appearance of the naive, beautiful, and strong transfer student, Miu Fuurinji.

For some reason the killer has been leaving a string of maddeningly arcane clues at each crime scene. Each of these clues, it seems, is an indecipherable roadmap to the next murder.\n\r\nOnto the scene comes L, the mysterious super-sleuth. Despite his peculiar working habits-he's never shown his face in public, for example-he's the most decorated detective in the world and has never tackled a case he hasn't been able to crack.\n\r\nBut this time he needs help.\n\r\nEnlisting the services of an FBI agent named Naomi Misora, L starts snooping around the City of Angels. It soon becomes apparent that the killing spree is a psychotic riddle designed to specifically engage L in a battle of wits. Stuck in the middle between killer and investigator, it's up to Misora to navigate both the dead bodies and the egos to solve the Los Angeles Murder Cases.\n\r\n(Source: VIZ Media)", "Image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/manga/2/202289.jpg"}, "y": -230.86526489257812, "x": -379.333984375, "id": "7458", "size": 1.0}, {"color": "rgb(255,173,179)", "label": "Soukai no Eve", "attributes": {"Score": 7.1, "Rank": "#8174", "Popularity": "#7229", "Members": "1,104", "Genres": "Adventure, Supernatural, Seinen", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/manga/28279\">Soukai no Eve</a>", "Synopsis": "It was supposed to be just a regular daily bus drive to their high school for Watanabe Sheena and her friend Yuk, but when the bus enters a thick fog, the unexpected happens and the bus gets transported to another world that seems prehistoric.

Nobody knows why he has come to that school or what the real motivations behind his actions are.\n\r\nDuring any match, Tom shows off all of his unique coolness and ability.\n\r\nHe employs a wide range of tricks, both psychological and physical, to ensure his victory. In any game, you will constantly ask how he's planning to win, why he's really doing certain things, and what's really going on. At the end of the matches, the tricks are revealed, and they all work in real life, even if they do require one to be highly skilled or lucky in order to perform them.\n\r\nThe story centers around the various matches he undertakes and the interactions between the various characters, like Mika Shishidou, the beautiful granddaughter of the school headmaster, who is highly intelligent but contemptuous and superb, or Abidani, the vampiric looking dorm superintendent and main villain (for now) in the series, who has a sadistic personality and whose goal is to make Tom leave his school (or to get him killed).\n\r\nAs the story unfolds, more about Tom's past is revealed, leading to unpredictable turns of events.\n\r\n(Source: MU)", "Image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/manga/3/164909.jpg"}, "y": -109.06332397460938, "x": -361.2650146484375, "id": "15167", "size": 3.10953950881958}, {"color": "rgb(138,223,255)", "label": "Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho", "attributes": {"Score": 7.09, "Rank": "#8261", "Popularity": "#4967", "Members": "1,736", "Genres": "Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi, Seinen", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/manga/7247\">Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho</a>", "Synopsis": "In an alternate history of the aftermath of World War II, Japan has been cleaved in half, with the south\u2014Honshu and the other islands\u2014allied with the United States and the northern island Hokkaido annexed by the enigmatic Union.

At birth, their parents left Ageha in the care of their grandmother in the countryside. Hana was raised in the big city with her parents. However, when the girls were in first grade, their grandmother became ill and so, Ageha was sent to live with her parents and her twin sister in the city.\n\r\nThe two girls are in high school now, and are complete opposites. Growing up in the countryside has made Ageha a bit of a tomboy; she's a quiet, reserved girl who doesn't look anything special. Hana, on the other hand, is outgoing, gorgeous and popular at school. Regardless, the two girls appear to have a stable, good relationship with one another.\n\r\nOne day when all of Ageha's classmates leave to attend a concert, Ageha finds herself alone to maintain the booth at school during the school fair. Ageha feels as if she's Cinderella who didn't get invited to go to the ball. Just when she was thinking those thoughts, a boy wearing a horse mask on his head runs into the classroom and hides underneath a table. His name is Kyuu. It turns out he's being chased by some girls. After the girls leave, Ageha is startled by Kyuu who demands that she serve him coffee. As she does so, Kyuu flips through her agenda booklet and discovers a photograph of Ageha and the boy she has a crush on, Ryuusei, who she has known from childhood but since they moved away, they have forgotten each other. Kyuu asks if she likes Ryuusei, and if she wants to be Ryuusei's girlfriend in a teasing sort of way, causing much embarrassment to the girl. Kyuu then tells her that if she believes in her heart that it is possible, it could come true. Kyuu tells her to shout out that she's Ryuusei's girlfriend and that they are going out and her life is very good, which Ageha does so. As soon as she speaks the words, Ryuusei appears at the classroom door, and recognizes Ageha as the girl from his childhood that he used to play with. Ageha secretly thinks of Kyuu as Cinderella's fairy godmother and cannot believe that it happened.\n\r\nHowever, as Ageha and Ryuusei rekindle a friendship from long ago, Hana becomes suspicious or jealous of Ageha's relationship with Ryuusei. She becomes especially annoyed when she finds out that Ryuusei prefers Ageha to her.
