# MALmap
An interactive map of anime based on MyAnimeList recommendations.

If you wish to see your MyAnimeList mapped to the graph, download the repo and run the python script or the last cell of the Jupyter notebook (or ask me for the data file), then open user_map.html(only works in Firefox or on a webserver).
