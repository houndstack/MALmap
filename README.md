# MALmap
An interactive map of anime based on MyAnimeList recommendations.

If you wish to see your MyAnimeList mapped to the graph, download the repo and run the python script user_export.py for anime or user_export_manga.py for manga(or ask me for the data file), then open index.html for anime and manga.html for manga(only works in Firefox or on a webserver).
