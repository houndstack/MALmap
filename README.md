1. Download the repo.
2. Run the python script user_export.py for anime or user_export_manga.py for manga. (In terminal, type: python user_export.py) Alternatively, I can send you the file if you PM me on MyAnimeList: igfod13 or Reddit: /u/igfod13.
3. Open index.html for anime and manga.html for manga(only works in Firefox or on a web server).

Note: As of July 14th, 2018, you must download your anime list from MyAnimeList in order to map your list. Place the xml file in the same directory as this folder and enter in the file name when prompted. 

See the [MyAnimelist forum topic](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1388802) for more info.
