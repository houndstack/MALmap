    "more": "MALmap is a visualization of anime using MyAnimeList recommendations. Each node represents an anime, while each edge represents the number of recommendations on MyAnimeList between the two anime. Only anime with recommendations by two or more users are recorded. Recommendation data was taken by scraping MyAnimeList.net on December 30, 2015. The graph was created in Gephi using ForceAtlas, Expansion, and slight Label Adjusting. The different colors representing each anime were obtained by running modularity in Gephi, which ended up highlighting the different anime genres pretty well. This site was made using the Sigma.js exporter for Gephi. <br><br>This page was created by igfod13. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to PM me on reddit(/u/igfod13) or on MyAnimeList(igfod13). MALmap v2 is currently in the works, so please let me know if you are interested in helping developing MALmap into a fully functional site.",
