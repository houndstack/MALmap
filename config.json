    "more": "MALmap is a visualization of anime using MyAnimeList recommendations. Each node represents an anime series, while each edge represents the number of recommendations on MyAnimeList between the two series. Recommendations between anime are only recorded if they are made by three or more users (as opposed to two before, due to density issues). Recommendation data was taken by scraping MyAnimeList.net on July 27, 2017. This graph was created in Gephi using ForceAtlas and slight Label Adjusting. The different colors representing each series were obtained by running modularity in Gephi, which ended up highlighting the different anime genres pretty well. This site was made using the Sigma.js exporter for Gephi. <br><br>This page was created by igfod13. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to PM me on reddit(/u/igfod13) or on MyAnimeList(igfod13). MALmap v2 is currently in the works, so please let me know if you are interested in helping develop MALmap into a fully functional recommendations site.",
