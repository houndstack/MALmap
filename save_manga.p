Highly lauded by his peers as one of the great young minds that will revolutionize the field, he is blessed with a beautiful fiancée and is on the cusp of a big promotion in the hospital he works at. But all of that is about to change with a grave dilemma that Kenzou faces one night\u2014whether to save the life of a small boy or that of the town's mayor. Despite being pressured by his superiors to perform surgery on the mayor, his morals force him to perform the surgery on the other critical patient, saving his life and forfeiting the mayor's. A doctor is taught to believe that all life is equal; however, when a series of murders occur in the surgeon's vicinity, all of the evidence pointing to the boy he saved, Kenzou's beliefs are shaken. Along his journey to unravel the true identity of his little patient, Kenzou discovers that the fate of the world may be intertwined with the mysterious child.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VThe story is set in future Japan, in which the sea level has risen and flooded many of the coastal areas and Mt. Fuji has erupted within living memory. The population has been considerably reduced and political and technological institutions have broken-down. Local communities have become nations and telephone and television no longer exist (although coffee vending machines and streetlights stubbornly continue to work). There are strange new animals and plants (like flying fish and glowing streetlight trees).\u000a\u000aThe remaining people have adopted a slower-paced, simpler way of life and rely more on each other. Along with the human population are some intelligent, humanoid robots. One of the robots, a female named Alpha, runs a café by the same name in the country outside of what remains of Yokohama. With her trusty motor scooter and her camera she travels around the area making friends with the humans and robots, having new experiences and observing the passage of time.

VMakunouchi Ippo has been bullied his entire life. Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to Takamura boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo\u2019s classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo\u2019s journey to the top of the boxing world begins.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VWhen Hikaru Shindou discovers an old go board in his grandfather's attic, he is greeted by the spirit of an ancient go master, Sai Fujiwara no. Sai spent his life teaching the techniques of the board game to an emperor during the Heian era, and now in his ghostly state, he is eager to share his passion with the unsuspecting Hikaru. The only problem is that Hikaru is not all that interested in board games. But Sai is not easily dissuaded. Pressured by Sai's unrelenting desire to pursue something he refers to as the "Divine Move," Hikaru begrudgingly consents to playing the game, executing moves as dictated by Sai. But slowly, intrigued by the dedication of his peers, he begins to learn the basics of the game.\u000a\u000aAs Hikaru enters into the world of go, guided by his intangible tutor and inspired by his rival, Akira Touya, he cannot help but be drawn into the complex game as he grows determined to prove his own abilities. In a coming-of-age story centering around an ancient board game, Hikaru no Go tells the story of a boy maturing through the pursuit of his newfound passion.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VTen years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money.\u000a\u000aOne wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past. \u000a\u000aNow in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 28: Meteor Strike

VAlchemists are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor.\u000a\u000aYears later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

But such pursuits require a license, and less than one in a hundred thousand can pass the grueling qualification exam. Those who do pass gain access to restricted areas, amazing stores of information, and the right to call themselves Hunters. \u000a\u000a(Source: Shonen Jump)

VAt Ouran High School, an academy where only the children of the rich and powerful attend, there exists a club consisting of the most elite of the student body: the legendary Host Club. Within the club's room, six beautiful, bored boys spend their time entertaining equally beautiful and bored girls.\u000a\u000aHaruhi Fujioka, a poor scholarship student, has no interest in the Host Club\u2014until she breaks a valuable vase in their clubroom. After being mistaken for a boy, Haruhi is forced by Kyouya Ootori to work for the Host Club to repay her debt. Tamaki Suou, the princely leader of the club, eagerly takes her under his wing to teach her the ways of the host.\u000a\u000aThings, however, are never quite so simple with the Host Club around. Even the most mundane events can turn into huge spectacles with the likes of prankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, stoic Takashi Morinozuka, and sweet Mitsukuni "Hunny" Haninozuka. The crazy adventures of the Host Club are just beginning, and Haruhi must learn how to survive in the glitzy world of the hosts.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aNote: The final volume contains a special bonus chapter where the group travels to Spain.

Unfortunately, O-Parts can be used for good or evil purposes.\u000a\u000aJio is a young boy with a tragic past who only trusts one thing in the world: money.

Into this world walks Gamma Akutabi, a man with a metal arm and a six-foot chainsaw, cybernetically enhanced master of the legendary martial art.\u000a\u000aBut it takes more than one man to find the ultimate prize.

Against an army of crooks and killers, against runaway trains and super-powered madmen, they'll need all their skills... but the most dangerous thing in the west might be the Rings themselves...\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Media)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shots:\u000aVolume 2: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine\u000aVolume 3: Kokumashi Urara (Rune Master Urara)\u000aVolume 4: Bad Shield United

VBusou Renkin is the story of the teenager Kazuki Mutou, who dies trying to save a girl who was being attacked by an eerie monster. The next morning, however, Kazuki is left wondering whether it was all a dream. Lo and behold, the girl, the monster, and his death are all real! The girl, Tokiko Tsumura, was actually trying to slay the homunculus (a beast that can take the form of humans, but whose main source of food is people), but Kazuki got in her way. To revive Kazuki, Tokiko replaces his heart with a "kakugane," an alchemic device that allows him to summon a lance with which to fight the monsters. It turns out that Tokiko is a member of Renkin Kenshi (Alchemist Soldiers)\u2014an organization sworn to protect the world from the diabolical creatures. Soon, Kazuki joins Tokiko in her quest to terminate the sinister being that creates and controls the homunculus.\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Medai)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 10: Embalming: Dead Body and Bride

Despite the samurai's attempts to combat the extraterrestrial menace, the Shogun soon realizes that their efforts are futile and decides to surrender. This marks the beginning of an uneasy agreement between the Shogunate and Amanto, one that results in a countrywide sword ban and the disappearance of the samurai spirit.\u000a\u000aHowever, there exists one eccentric individual who wields a wooden sword and refuses to let his samurai status die. Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet.

VRyoma Echizen just joined the Seishun Academy's tennis team, which is known for being one of the most competitive teams in Japan. Its members are incredibly talented, gifted, and athletic. With rigorous and extremely intense practices, the upperclassmen of the team expect the very best from themselves and they expect even more from the new members of the team. While most of the freshmen are on pins and needles hoping they won't get cut from the team, Ryoma Echizen is confident, cool, and collected. Some might even say he's cocky, but at least he's got the skills to back up his attitude. With his virtually unreturnable "twist serve," Ryoma is sure to make the starting team.\u000a\u000aJoin Ryoma and the other first years, as they train hard, make friends, and try to find a place for themselves on the team. And meet Ryoma's cute but chronically shy classmate Sakuno Ryuzaki. She's got a big crush on Ryoma, but will he ever notice her? Ryoma Echizen is the Prince of Tennis. He may be ready for the Seishun Academy tennis team, but are THEY ready for HIM?\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Media)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 5: Tennis no Ouji-sama (pilot)

VHanamichi Sakuragi, a tall, boisterous teenager with flame-red hair and physical strength beyond his years, is eager to put an end to his rejection streak of 50 and finally score a girlfriend as he begins his first year of Shohoku High. However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: "I hate basketball" and "I need a girlfriend."\u000a\u000aHaruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn't because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him.

Of these, the Seven Heroes halted the invasion to herald a time of prosperity while the four Lances of Betrayal were supposedly defeated.\u000a\u000aTwo decades later, the Lances of Betrayal have reappeared and formed a bandit militia near the frontier fief Gormbark. A man with the black sword and a scar over his left eye slays an entire troop of that militia. He is identified as a boy, Kóinzell, and becomes as much an object of fear as of hope even as his own past, motivations, and purpose are a mystery to those he meets in his travel.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VThe story follows Alice Seno, a 15-year-old girl forever shadowed by her older sister Mayura, who is good at everything she does. At school she is known as "Mayura's little sister" and is relentlessly tormented by the older girls who know that Alice is too weak to fight back.\u000a\u000aAlice harbors a deep affection for Kyo Wakamiya, a handsome upperclassman who is on the archery team with Mayura. On the way to school one day, Alice rescues a white rabbit from the road despite the danger to herself, but gets rescued by Kyo and receives a bracelet with a single red stone. The rabbit she saves, however, is no ordinary rabbit. She reveals her true form to Alice and introduces herself as Nyozeka. Alice is told that she is destined to become a Lotis Master. The Lotis Masters use the power of words and communication to enter the Inner Heart of others. It is a powerful ability to be used carefully as Alice soon finds out.\u000a\u000aUsing the power of the Lotis Words, which reveal themselves to be in the form of runes, Alice accidentally makes her older sister disappear during a dispute over Kyo, whom Mayura had begun dating. Alice then must use the Lotis Words to try and bring her sister back from the dark. She is joined by Kyo who proves to have the Lotis powers as well, and by Frey, another Lotis master who had trained with the masters and arrives with the intention to marry Alice. Unfortunately, Mayura has been taken by the power of the Maram Words, the dark reflection of the Lotis Words. Their only hope lies in Alice and Kyo becoming the legendary Neo-Masters to discover the lost word bonding both Maram and Lotis.\u000a\u000a(Source: Mangatraders)

VAoyagi Ritsuka is one troubled 6th grader. Two years ago, he mysteriously lost his memory and developed an alternate personality. His mother constantly berates (and occasionally beats) him, asking what happened to the "real" Ritsuka, and his only defender and friend, his older brother Seimei, was recently killed.\u000a\u000aSuddenly, Seimei's apparent "friend," Soubi, appears. Soubi tells him that Ritsuka's true name is "Loveless," and that Soubi was assigned by Seimei to take care of Ritsuka and protect him. Ritsuka soon gets sucked into a bizzare underground society where teams of people, a "Fighter Unit," and a "Sacrifice," battle using elaborate and beautifully-phrased spells.\u000a\u000aHe seeks both acceptance of himself, and the answer to the mystery of who killed his brother and why.\u000a\u000a(Source: TokyoPop)

One day, he forgets his copy of Les Fleurs du Mal in the classroom and runs back alone to pick it up. In the classroom, he finds not only his book, but Saeki's gym uniform. On a mad impulse, he steals it.\u000a\u000aNow everyone knows "some pervert" stole Saeki's uniform, and Kasuga is dying with shame and guilt. Furthermore, the weird, creepy, and friendless girl of the class, Nakamura, saw him take the uniform.

Will it be possible for Kasuga to get closer to Saeki, despite Nakamura's meddling and his dark secret? What exactly does Nakamura intend to do with him?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VRiding the bus one day, Sakurakouji Sakura looks out the window to see people being burned alive with a blue fire and a boy her age who's unharmed and standing over the people. She comes back to the site the next day and there are no corpses or evidence of any kind of murder, just a small fire. She then goes to class to find there's a new transfer student, Oogami Rei, who looks exactly like the boy she saw before and wears a black glove only on his left hand. Oogami is a Code Breaker, one who "does not exist." He is a seemingly cold-blooded killer who follows the principle of "an eye for an eye," to "use evil against evil." Convinced that killing is not right, Sakurakouji sets out to stop him and penetrate his icy heart.

VSennen no Yuki focuses on Chiyuki Matsuoka, a high school girl hospitalized with a heart problem. Since birth her heart has been very weak and she was told that she would probably live to be only fifteen. However, one day she meets Touya Kanou, a vampire, with the opposite problem: Touya has lived for about one thousand years. It's customary for a vampire at his age of eighteen to choose a human partner to be with for 1000 years who in turn would let him drink their blood and share his life span for the millennium.\u000a\u000aEarly in the series, Chiyuki offers Touya her blood, so that she would be able to live longer, but Touya refuses, claiming he dislikes the sight and taste of blood. In the beginning, he even looks down on humans, believing that they are weak creatures who will only die before him and leave him behind, but later on he, with the help of Chiyuki, starts to see the world in a different perspective.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 1: Isshunkan no Romance (A Romance of One Moment)

Mai Taniyama and her classmates have heard the rumors that the creepy old high school is haunted-possibly by ghosts from the Second World War. So one rainy day they gather at the told school to tell ghost stories, hoping to attract one of the suspected spirits.\u000a\u000aNo ghosts materialize, but Mai and her friends do meet Kazuya Shibuya, the handsome young owner of Shibuya Psychic Research, who's been hired to investigate paranormal activity at the school. Also at the scene are an exorcist, a Buddhist monk, a woman who can speak with the dead, and an outspoken Shinto priestess. Surely one of them will have the talents to solve this mystery!\u000a\u000a(Source: Del Rey Manga)

In a last-ditch effort to reveal her love to him, she writes a long (but anonymous) love letter. When Karasuma ends up postponing his transfer for another year, Tenma realizes she has to tell him how she feels before time runs out again. But her extreme nervousness around him prompts her to try and set up all sorts of schemes to get close to him and let him know, without actually coming out and saying it.

Around this love triangle of clueless people are a few of Tenma's friends, and her younger (but older looking, more mature, and more popular) sister, Yakumo.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

VMinaguchi Kaoru is nothing special. He's no good at sports or school, isn't in any clubs, and he's not popular. He has no friends and isn't even interested in any of the girls he knows. He's also teased due to the fact that he loves shoujo manga. Unlike the harem daydreams of his peers, he dreams of finding his true love. Unfortunately, a shinigami comes to kill him, simply because he's a "forever alone" sort of guy. When he gasps out his intention of embracing life with his final breaths, though, she takes it back! As long as he follows through on his intentions, he won't be killed.\u000a\u000aTo convince the shinigami that his plans are genuine, he declares that he will confess to the girl he likes, the very next day. Expecting failure with confessing to random girls in his school, he sends out love letters to four different girls. To his surprise, they all agree to be his girlfriend. Now, this shoujo-manga-loving guy has ended up in a kind of harem story, quadruple-timing four girls! Will he be able to stay involved enough with society to avoid an early death?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VAs a 6-year-old, Rintaro is diagnosed with Henisei Tashu Ijou Syndrome (also known as Hentai Syndrome), a disease that could kill him if he gets sexually aroused. To save him and provide a way for him to live as normal a life as possible, his father teaches him the ways to control his body and mind for ten years in the mountains, with the martial art of the Koei Sougetsu. When he's 16 he chooses to enroll into Nangokuren High School, which he assumed to be the biggest all-boys school in the country but is actually the biggest all-girls school that has just gone co-ed.\u000a\u000aOn his first day he stumbles upon a large scale battle and learns that the first rule of the school is that it "Abides the Law of Nature" which has turned the campus into a war zone-like environment. Rintaro now sees transferring out as his mission, but will it be that easy now that he's caught the eye of the 3 "Dragons," the bodacious female leaders of the three biggest factions around?\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VMizuki Konno is your typical high school junior at Yanno Prefectural High School. Like many teens her age she is studying hard for college and when she has some down time she likes to fuss over fashion and make-up. While she may not be one of the class elites, Mizuki is fortunate to be on the right side of her class's idols. But that might not settle well with those who are in a similar academic status but not so lucky with their social lives.\u000a\u000aMizuki really isn't a bad person. However she understands that she is one of the haves. And even if she only has so a strand to hold on to, that's much more than the introverts or the socially inept.\u000a\u000aOn the day of the field trip, Mizuki's position with the cool kids cannot be better. But now a good portion of her class are now firmly against her. While this "lower" clique may not be united, their hatred is much stronger than their differences. Unfortunately tragedy strikes in the form of a traffic accident. And now the class is split into two new groups...the living and the dead!\u000a\u000aAlmost the entire class has been wiped out and the five remaining girls are injured and lost in the wilderness. They also hate each other, and in a mix of Lord of the Flies with Heathers these girls begin to assert their wills against each other to try to survive while enacting a new class structure where looks and style is no longer the definition of influence.\u000a\u000a(Source: Vertical)

VHigh school student Ginji Kusanagi is about to make his dreams come true. He's made his professional boxing debut and is ready to go on the first date with the girl of his dreams, Minako. However, the unthinkable has happened. Ginji is in an accident, and his spirit is seperated from his body, effectively killing him before his time. A (sort of) angel tells him that he can be reincarnated as an animal and return to his body after he's lived out its lifespan. He chooses to be reincarnated as a penguin, Minako's favorite animal. Now Ginji lives with Minako as Gin the penguin and just tries to make it along as a penguin while waiting to be returned to his body.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

VFor Mikan, there was no better friend than Hotaru (though Hotaru sometimes seems to have other sentiments). They often played together. But Hotaru is a very special child, and she agrees to go to a school in Tokyo which the government reserved only for geniuses. This left a very lonely Mikan at home. When Hotaru fails to keep her promise and come home for holidays, her young friend is very disappointed and rather angry. But upon overhearing a conversation between Hotaru's mother and a teacher, Mikan realizes that her friend's reasons for leaving might not have been what they seemed. So Mikan takes it upon herself to run away and go to Hotaru's school. There she discovers the so-called "genius academy" is actually a school for people gifted with special powers called "alices." Her friend Hotaru is one of these, and after a chance encounter with a teacher, Mikan suddenly finds herself enrolled. Finally, the two friends are reunited, but is Mikan actually one of those so-called Alices?\u000a\u000a(Source: Aerie Scans)

Clearly, only one of them is the true priest, and unfortunately for Fuuto, it is he. As the celestial guardians come to dispose of him they discover that he is not, as their leader Naga says, a fake. Fuuto just wants to be normal and live a normal life, but he is constantly drawn into trouble as he has an extremely keen spiritual sense and the ability to soothe ghosts. \u000a\u000a(Source: Tokyopop)

Enter the "Handymen," Nic and Worick, who take care of the jobs no one else will handle. Until the day when a cop they know on the force requests their help in taking down a new gang muscling in on the territory of a top Mafia family. It seems like business (and mayhem) as usual, but the Handymen are about to find that this job is a lot more than they bargained for.\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Media)

Sister Rosette Christopher, an exorcist working as a part of the Magdala Order, has a duty to fight the demons which appear and cause destruction. But along with her companion Chrno, she usually ends up causing more destruction than the demons themselves!

As Rosette and Chrno work to save her, more is revealed about the relationship between them. There is more to these two than meets the eye.\u000a\u000a(Source: ADV)

VThis is the story of a terrible crime committed against a 17-old-girl, committed, in part, by 17-year-old boys. Why did such a thing happen? Why was no one able to prevent it?\u000a\u000aIn the beginning, high school boys Hiroki and his friend Takashi are rescued from bullying by a notorious gangster, Miyamoto. At first, they are thrilled to be under his protection, and cheerfully run off anyone who threatens them with the mere mention of Miyamoto's name. Soon, they learn that there is a lot more to being in Miyamoto's gang than just being protected. In return, they're expected to offer loyalty and obedience, or face possibly deadly consequences. This becomes harder as the violence and the crimes they find themselves committing begins to escalate.\u000a\u000aOne night, they kidnap a high school girl, Sachiko. Now Hiroki has two battles to face. Internally, he faces the dissonance between his sense of self-preservation and his conscience. Externally, Sachiko's twin sister Miki, who goes to Hiroki's high school, her parents and the police are searching for the missing girl. Will Sachiko ever return home? What kind of person--or monster--will Hiroki become?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VKarin is a cute little girl who also happens to be a vampire...with a twist. Once a month, she experiences intense bleeding from her nose\u2014we're talking gushers! In other words, she's a vamp with blood to spare, so rather than stealing blood from humans she actually gives her blood to them. If done right, this can be an extremely positive experience that benefits the "victim" as much as the vampire. The problem is that Karin never seems to do things right!\u000a\u000a(Source: Tokyopop)

Because whenever he deals with the supernatural, he gets the hiccups.\u000a\u000aBut no matter, an endless stream of desperate people come to him troubled by what he calls allegories. Those are stories, usually urban legends, that one believes to be true and if one believes strong enough can cause them to become true. His first case involves "The Man Under The Bed." Can he stop this creepy man with an axe before he chops up Hiranuma Kanae? Why does Asou count his hiccups and just who is that strange girl in his bathroom?\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

V"Mushi": the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply "being." They are beyond the shackles of the words "good" and "evil." Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows.\u000a\u000aThis is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.\u000a\u000aSo what are mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a "Mushishi," Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.\u000a\u000aGinko relentlessly chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer.\u000a\u000aIt could, after all, lead to the meaning of life itself.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

Coming from a distinguished family, he is an infamous perfectionist\u2014not only is he highly critical of himself, but of others as well. The only thing stopping Shinichi from leaving for Europe is his fear of flying.

On the surface, she seems to be an unkempt girl with no direction in life. However, when Shinichi hears Nodame play the piano for the first time, he is in awe of the kind of music she creates. Nevertheless, Shinichi is dismayed to discover that Nodame is his neighbor, and worse, she ends up falling head over heels in love with him.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aThe last two volumes titled, Nodame Cantabile: Encore Opera-hen, contain sequel to the main series.

Yaya the misfi-ya!\u201d But no matter how badly they act, Yaya is just too naïve and trusting to believe the worst of her friends. Hard-rocking, butt-kicking Nana is just the girl to grab hold of Yaya\u2019s timid demeanor and turn it upside down. Nana exposes Yaya\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d as slime bags, doles out punishment, and does it all with style. Can there be anything that terminally shy Yaya and hyper-confident Nana have in common? Well, for one thing, they\u2019re the same person. . . (Source: Del Rey)

To determine who deserves the title, they must go to the Human World and enter a strange competition. Whoever attracts the most human boys . . . wins!\u000a\u000aHere's how it works: When a boy falls for a witch-girl, she utters a few mystic words and the boy's heart will be hers in jewel-like form.

VKurozuchou, a small fogbound town on the coast of Japan, is cursed. According to Shuichi Saito, the withdrawn boyfriend of teenager Kirie Goshima, their town is haunted not by a person or being but by a pattern: uzumaki, the spiral, the hypnotic secret shape of the world. It manifests itself in small ways: seashells, ferns, whirlpools in water, whirlwinds in air. And in large ways: the spiral marks on people's bodies, the insane obsessions of Shuichi's father, the voice from the cochlea in your inner ear. As the madness spreads, the inhabitants of Kurouzu-cho are pulled ever deeper, as if into a whirlpool from which there is no return...\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Media)

VBefore Eikichi Onizuka became a legend, before Onibaku, before he became GTO, he was just a normal junior high school delinquent. Getting into fights with his seniors, trying to pick up girls and just hanging out with his friends. Bad Company is a compilation of many short stories, linked together with the characters of Eikichi, Ryuji and their school buds. Such stories involve the origins of Eikichi`s bike, which we see frequently in GTO, the first meeting with the Midnight Angel and many other.

VAlone in his dorm room one Saturday night (a frequent occurrence, to be honest), young Keiichi Morisato accidentally dials a wrong number that will literally change his life. You see, he inadvertently reaches the Goddess Technical Help Line, and a goddess is dispatched to grant him one wish.\u000a\u000aThe lovely young Belldandy informs him that he may have one wish - a wish for virtually anything in the world. In disbelief, Keiichi opts for a wish he believes will confound the system (and will prove that Belldandy has no particular wish-granting power): he wishes that Belldandy would stay with him always.\u000a\u000aThe power of this wish almost rips the fabric of time and space but it is ultimately granted. But of course such a wish has unforseen consequences, including the fact that Keiichi lives in a guys-only dorm. When his roommates return to find him with a woman on the premises, he is immediately tossed out on to the street. But the wish also has other unexpected side effects - such as when Keiichi and Belldandy are in peril of being separated, a motorcycle is suddenly repaired so that they can travel together.\u000a\u000a(Source: Dark Horse)

VA middle school BOY and a beautiful OL, an extraordinary love story, from their meeting until goal in." Akemi is a beautiful OL, who is rather bored by the unchanging everyday life. To make things interesting, she plays a little game. A simple game. Every day at 7:14, she gets on her usual bus, picks another rider that piques her interest, and sits next to them. If they do a double-take on her, she wins her game. It was just supposed to kill time, but it turned out to be quite entertaining. One who is sleeping suddenly wakes up, one who is reading stops in realization... a short game. Still, a fun one. Until one day, she sits next to a kid who doesn't seem to take notice of her. Was he just pre-occupied? Maybe he's just too young? Akemi is irked, and finds that she has to up her ante, determined to win this game.\u000a\u000aThe volume also includes 3 one-shots: Yukai no Susume, Kedama no Cake, Kinou Kenka wo Shimashita.

VLurking within the shadows of Tokyo are frightening beings known as "ghouls," who satisfy their hunger by feeding on humans once night falls. An organization known as the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG) has been established in response to the constant attacks on citizens and as a means of purging these creatures. However, the problem lies in identifying ghouls as they disguise themselves as humans, living amongst the masses so that hunting prey will be easier. Ken Kaneki, an unsuspecting university freshman, finds himself caught in a world between humans and ghouls when his date turns out to be a ghoul after his flesh.\u000a\u000aBarely surviving this encounter after being taken to a hospital, he discovers that he has turned into a half-ghoul as a result of the surgery he received. Unable to satisfy his intense craving for human meat through conventional means, Kaneki is taken in by friendly ghouls who run a coffee shop in order to help him with his transition. As he begins what he thinks will be a peaceful new life, little does he know that he is about to find himself at the center of a war between his new comrades and the forces of the CCG, and that his new existence has caught the attention of ghouls all over Tokyo.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VThought your life was bad? Sometimes, death is worse. There is no salvation, peace, nor god waiting to receive you into their care. But wait, a god? Maybe you are talking about that big black ball stuck in the room with you. Now you are thrown into a game, fighting green aliens and robot monsters for the chance to survive.\u000a\u000aWhen Kei Kurono is killed, he thus finds himself caught in such a game; a test of his skills, morals and will to survive. His life is not his own, his death spat and trampled upon over and over again. What happens if he does not listen? God knows.\u000a\u000aA word of warning: Gantz is not for the faint-hearted, but neither is it as simple as it looks. Gore, rape and violence is rampant, as are portrayals of greed, violence, and all the ugliness that one sees in society today.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VIchijou Kazuya thought that he was murdered, but when he came to, he was back in his high school days. He lived his entire life as a playboy and had had countless sexual encounters with women until that fateful day that he was killed. He realizes that his murderer was his old high school friend Tanaka Masaki who was jealous of Kazuya\u2019s relationships and his built up anger eventually exploded.\u000a\u000aTaken back 15 years into his past, it seems that he has been given a second chance at life and given a chance to make different choices. He decides that the way to prevent his eventual demise is to make sure Masaki is more successful with girls and loses his virginity before Kazuya. But fate seems to be steering Kazuya towards the path of his previous life and keeps introducing the same girls he had sexual encounters with.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VThe story of Kodomo no Jikan is centered around 23-year-old Aoki Daisuke, who has just landed his first teaching job as a grade school teacher at Futatsubashi Elementary School. He is placed in charge of Class 3-1, where one of his students, a mischievously precocious Rin Kokonoe, develops a crush on him and goes so far as to proclaim herself Aoki's girlfriend. She aggressively pursues her efforts to be with her teacher despite the fact that he will lose his job if she gets too close, a situation further complicated by the often complex, intertwining relationships existing between them and their respective friends, families, and peers.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

VIt is the Middle Ages, and the remnants of mankind are plagued by paranoia and death. Spoken in fearful whispers, the word "Yoma" cuts a clear image into the minds of all: monstrous beings with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. But fear of their gruesome appetite is dwarfed by that of their ability to shapeshift and steal the memories of their last meal. Forever vulnerable to attack, humans live in unease, even among family.\u000a\u000aThere are few means to kill a Yoma. The Organization, informally known as "Claymore," is humanity's only line of defense, dispatching half-human, half-Yoma female warriors to purify villages of Yoma. A lonely and dangerous existence, death for these warriors comes with each new assignment. What time is found between trying battles and long, arduous travels is spent in ever-intensifying struggle to resist their Yoma blood and maintain their humanity. Villagers, knowing of this, pay for their security reluctantly and have only loathsome regard for their protectors.\u000a\u000aClaymore follows the stoic and low-ranking member Clare in her daunting trek as she searches for personal vengeance. Along the way, she encounters many unexpected things about the world, from the camaraderie and hope held fast by her sisters-in-arms to the sinister truth behind the Claymore Organization.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VLucky Star's story portrays the lives of several school girls attending a Japanese high school with a very loose humor tone. The setting is based on the town Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture. The main heroine is Konata Izumi, an athletic and intelligent girl who, despite these attributes, is not in a sports club, and has low grades. Her laziness at school is due to her love for anime and video games and lack of interest in anything else. The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara. As the story progresses, they move onto their second and third year.\u000a(Source: MU)

VIn the mystical realm of Earth Land, magic exists at the core of everyday life for its inhabitants, from transportation to utilities and everything in between. However, even with all its benefits, magic can also be used for great evil; therefore, to prevent dark forces from upsetting the natural order of things, there exists a system of magical guilds in the Kingdom of Fiore. Under the command of their respective guild masters, these guilds are made up of witches and wizards who take on various job requests to earn fame and fortune. One particular guild stands high above the rest in both strength and spirit, and its name is Fairy Tail.\u000a\u000aIn his quest to find his dragon foster father\u2014Igneel\u2014Natsu Dragneel, a fiery and reckless mage, and his partner Happy run into a young celestial mage by the name of Lucy Heartfilia, who reveals that it's her dream to become a full-fledged wizard and join the Fairy Tail guild. After rescuing her from an abduction attempt, Natsu offers her a home in Fairy Tail. Now a member of the guild, Lucy teams up with Natsu and befriends fellow wizards Gray Fullbuster and Erza "Titania" Scarlet. Together, this motley crew set out on their many adventures, gaining many faithful allies and deadly foes along the way.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VWelcome to Momoko's waking nightmare. Things were settled. They were! She was SUPPOSED to have gone to a normal school, made normal friends, and led a blissfully normal life. But the universe is just cruelly, irredeemably, monstrously unfair, so instead she found herself thrown out of home, stuck in an all-boys boarding school with a roommate she hates, cursed with a hideous haircut and wearing clothes which, to be frank, she wouldn't be seen dead in.\u000a\u000aAnd the only thing worse than her current situation is the one that she'll be in if anyone ever realizes that she is, in fact, a girl. Everything is wrong! Everything! Particularly the fact that, even though she's surrounded by amazingly gorgeous guys, her chances of romance are less than zero. But with life this complicated, something is bound to give. In fact, it just did. Damn.\u000a\u000a(Source: Storm in Heaven)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shots:\u000aVolume 2: Nopan Musume.

VMaeda Hachibei is peculiar, because, when most males lusting after gorgeous females, he instead lusts after discrete parts. When he relocates to Tokyo to attend school, he finds himself living in a dormitory with five females, each possessing a distinct ideal physical trait he desires: gorgeous blue eyes, bullet-train breasts, a deep dulcet voice, and straight "anime-esque" legs. Can he manage to keep his wits when these women surround him? Although you would not be completely incorrect if you believe this is like Love Hina\u2026 Hachibei is no Keitaro. \u000a\u000a(Source: Musashi Quality)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 12: The Boy Who Heard Too Much

VDuring a flashback, an interviewer inquires Kuzumi Taiga, a prospective student for Seinagi Private High School, on what he would do if he could use magic, during his entrance interview. He replies, "take over the world", with an outburst of laughter from an attractive girl, following his answer. After the entrance exam, the school rejects his application; although he recalls almost nothing after this event, he does recall the girl, and believes the cause of his school of choice rejecting his application involves her. Wandering around outside of the school the next day, Kuzumi tries to enter, but an invisible barrier blocks him. A teacher, Mr. Hiiragi, confuses Kuzumi for a student of the school ditching class and pulls Kuzumi into the school through the barrier. Seinagi Private High School is actually a magic school\u2014and Kuzumi is a teenager with no magical skill.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VCross Academy is an elite boarding school with two separate, isolated classes: the Day Class and the Night Class. On the surface, Yuuki Cross and Zero Kiryuu are prefects of the academy, and attempt to keep order between the students as classes rotate in the evenings. As the Night Class is full of utterly gorgeous elites, this can sometimes prove to be a bit difficult. It is completely necessary, however, as those "elites" are actually vampires. Yuuki and Zero act as guardians, protecting the secrets of the Night Class and the safety of their ignorant morning counterparts.\u000a\u000aAs the adopted daughter of the academy's chairman, Yuuki takes her job with a serious and energetic attitude. It also allows her to interact with her secret crush and savior, the president of the Night students' dorm, Kaname Kuran. Zero, on the other hand, has a deep-rooted hatred against vampires, and at times, does not hesitate to kill.\u000a\u000aCan vampires and humans co-exist, even in the strict setup of the Cross Academy? Only time will tell.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 17: Watashi to Fukigen na Panya-san (The Sour-Faced Baker and Me)

VHyun-Bin has been surviving on the streets by hiding the fact that she's a girl. In a tragic turn of events, her beloved little brother dies and Hyun-Bin runs away from the begging, from the gangs - straight into the clutches of a rich family. Her life might have become better but it's far from rosy: she has to undergo strict training every day and guard the family's youngest member, innocent and princess-like Yae-Ha. There are  only two rules, Hyun-Bin has to protect Yae-Ha with her life and no one must ever find out that she's a girl. It's a lonely and cold way of life but a fateful encounter with the delinquent Yun-Ha becomes a catalyst of changes to come, where loyalty and a sense of duty clash with feelings of love...\u000a\u000a(Source: dollie_mixtures)

In accordance with this, Airi Hoshina strictly follows her routine in preparation for her dream life: to have a loving, wholesome husband and family. However, Airi's life takes a fantastical turn when a young boy appears from her hand mirror.\u000a\u000aNamed Aram Astale Ei Daemonia Eucalystia, the young prince of Astale is fleeing his kingdom to evade a magical spell. Unknowingly, his portal leads directly to Airi's hand mirror. Though he avoided the brunt of the spell, his escape did not completely save him from the magic's effects: a spell that was originally supposed to turn Aram into an old man instead ages his body to that of a 17-year-old whenever it is dark. Now, the only way to turn him back is a kiss from his beloved maiden. Busy trying to find her one true love, Airi wants nothing to do with it, but Aram insists his soulmate must be her!\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

After incurring a debt of 150 million yen, they disappear, and Hayate was left holding the bag. Whilst running away from the debt collectors, he tries to kidnap a girl for ransom (however, the girl misunderstands his intentions and thinks he is confessing his love to her).

VIn the year 2015, the Angels, huge, tremendously powerful, alien war machines, appear in Tokyo for the second time. The only hope for Mankind's survival lies in the Evangelion, a humanoid fighting machine developed by NERV, a special United Nations agency. Capable of withstanding anything the Angels can dish out, the Evangelion's one drawback lies in the limited number of people able to pilot them. Only a handful of teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the Angels first appeared, are able to interface with the Evangelion. One such teenager is Shinji Ikari, whose father heads the NERV team that developed and maintains the Evangelion. Thrust into a maelstrom of battle and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything.\u000a\u000a(Source: AniDB)

Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants "love and peace," as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.\u000a\u000aAs the series progresses, more is gradually learned about Vash's mysterious history and the history of the human civilization on Gunsmoke, the desert planet the series is set on. The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense.

VSeventeen years ago, mysterious immortal soldiers known as "divine warriors" appeared on the battlefields of Africa. These life forms later became known as "Ajin," or demi-humans, and were considered to be one of the greatest discoveries of mankind. The government declared their existence to be compatible with humans; however, it is rumored that they instead offer bounties for captured Ajin to secretly perform inhumane experiments on these rare beings.\u000a\u000aKei Nagai, an apathetic high school student, is studying to become a doctor and only wishes to live a normal life. However, this simple dream is shattered after he suddenly gets into a deadly traffic accident. Reviving at the scene, he is immediately labeled as an Ajin by bounty-hungry witnesses. Unable to understand his immortality or prove his innocence, he starts to live his life on the run and fights for survival. He barely escapes the government's reach when a group of anarchistic Ajin contacts Kei, asking him to join their forces to retaliate against the government. But who is Kei's real enemy, and which side will he take when it comes down to humans versus Ajin?\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VOn the outskirts of Tokyo stands Hachimitsu Private Academy, a storied all-girls boarding school for elite young women full of potential and good breeding. But as the new school year rolls around, one tradition is going out the window: For the first time in the school's long history, boys are being allowed to enroll. But on the first day of school, only five boys make the cut. Kiyoshi Fujino, one of the lucky few, is thrilled by this discovery, his heart leaping with joy at the thought of being surrounded by all those girls, day in and day out. But little does he know of the shocking fate that awaits him.\u000a\u000a(Source: Yen Press)

VIn the panic surrounding a worldwide pandemic which kills 15 percent of the population and cripples many more, a secret organization, the Propater, topples the UN and seizes control of much of the world. A boy and a girl, raised in an abandoned virology research center, immune to the virus, are attacked by the Propater and escape.\u000a\u000aTwenty years later, the boy is the most powerful drug lord in South America. He aids his son from behind the scenes as he evades and eventually with the help of mercenaries from Nomad (some of them former Propater operatives) fights the Propater. As the plot develops focus shifts away from the main character and develops many sub-plots dedicated to terrorism, Human-improvement, the struggle of the developing countries and the power battles between the drug cartels and Propater.\u000a\u000aBased strongly on Gnostic mythology, all major characters are named after gnostic deities, and have analogous roles.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VSaiki Takaya, a guy who is easily misunderstood, one day finds a flask containing the succubus Lilim. She is very attractive but, she also has the tendency to drain the life force out of people. She surprises the life out of him (literally) when she kisses him unconscious. The girl, Lilim, turns out to be a succubus who gains energy by kissing guys. Lilim then flies off for more "food," but returns later, saying that Takaya's life-energy was the "tastiest." From then, Lilim is accepted by Takaya's parents as a live-in girlfriend of sorts, and Takaya's heart seems to start wavering towards this voluptuous devil.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VFourteen-year-old Kakeru Kurosawa is an antisocial junior high school student who looks down on his classmates\u2014but beneath his superiority complex is a hopeless young teenager who uses masturbation as a pastime. Using erotic thoughts of his female classmates as stimulus, he locks himself daily in a seldom-used girl's bathroom at school to do his dirty deed.\u000a\u000aOne day during class, Kurosawa witnesses the popular girls bullying the timid Aya Kitahara. Although not one to be riled over such matters, he decides to deliver retribution with his own hands. In a daring move, he steals the uniforms of the bullies and dispenses his "white justice" over them.\u000a\u000aAlthough satisfied with his exploits, Kurosawa's troubles are only just beginning. While going about his daily routine, he is suddenly confronted by Kitahara, who identifies him as the culprit behind the uniform incident, and blackmails him into terrorizing the other girls in the class the same way he dealt with her bullies. Left with little choice, Kurosawa agrees, and thus begins a coming-of-age story that deals with consequences, bullying, and people's ability to change.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VIn today's world of computers and cell phones, few people have time for superstition and ghost stories\u2014but that doesn't mean that they aren't real! Amane Kamori is a powerful medium from a remote village in rural Japan. Her guardian is Hyoue Inugami, a demon dog whose powers are literally fueled by her kiss! Together they protect humans from vengeful spirits and bring peace to the dead.\u000a\u000aBut when Amane's family moves to the big city of Tokyo, all the magical power in the world can't help her survive high school! Her chilly demeanor and lack of social graces make her a campus misfit. Popularity comes much easier to Hyoue, whose sexy good looks (in his human form) bring him lots of female fans. But Hyoue's lapdog loyalty to Amane only leads to more woe, as jealous classmates can't understand what he sees in her. If only they knew...\u000a\u000a(Source: Go! Comi)

VHigh schooler Shiina Shinya thinks that all girls are pretty much good-for-nothing, mostly because he doesn't understand them at all. That doesn't stop him from being surrounded by strange girls! Tsubasa Tooka, a cute, much-admired girl, stalks him. Shikimura Masami is majorly into masochism, and has recruited Shinya into her play sessions. Ikari Satsuki seems suspiciously interested in the recent serial stabbings, and seems to want to drag Shinya into it. Banjou Yoruko, a normally quiet, bookish girl, has decided she and Shinya are bound up in some fantasy setting. Uchida Yumeji is the school's sleeping beauty, who spends all of her time in the infirmary because she requires so much sleep. Shinya brings her newspapers, so she can keep up with current events in the short time she spends awake. Lastly, Okui Akane is convinced she is a vampire. For all Shinya knows, it could be true, but in practice it just means that he has to let her drink his blood. How will Shinya deal with all these good-for-nothing girls that complicate his life? \u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VHyoudou Kaname and Shishido Makoto are two abnormally tall (over 180 cm!), sharp-eyed high school girls. That, in addition to Kaname's emotional instability and violent outbursts, has instilled a fear of the two girls in all their classmates. But, though they're bad at dealing with people, they are actually normal girls. They just want to hang out with friends, have boyfriends, and enjoy high school like other girls, but they fail whenever they try. If they don't get discouraged and continue to work at getting to know others, will a day come when they can smile and be happy? It's a high tension school comedy drawn with a unique style and tempo.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VIn a land where magicians cast spells on bullets in order to perform magic, like summoning powerful monsters. There was once a witch so powerful that she challenged the gods and was cursed for it.\u000a\u000a10 years before the current time of the story, that witch challenged and defeated another magician, and in doing so saved a small boy, who instantly fell in love with her and was inspired to use guns as his "Sword of Justice". That boy was called Zero. When he was ready, he set out on a quest and found that woman who saved his life... or did he? She is not the same person that he idealized; she is selfish, rude, arrogant... and quite a bit shorter. But at the times when she feels Zero's love and self sacrifice for her, she can bring forth incredible power. So the two set out together to find a cure and the reason why the gods only bothered to curse her.

VHina's new high school is strange to say the least. She moves back to her old home town only to find that the high school is run by two opposing factors, and students identify themselves based on the color of their school uniforms: Black for the followers of the loud, violent Nishizaki, and white for the followers of quiet, clean-freak Isshiki. And then there are the "grays," who wear street clothes. Hina finds herself stuck between the leaders of the two factions, and it seems to be turning violent.\u000a\u000aAs one might guess from the girly art and the Ribon publisher, the plot develops a romance element pretty early on in the series. There's a love triangle involved among two of the group leaders. Who will Hina choose?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaDownloads)

VIn a high school classroom, students mourn the loss of one of their own: Tomie Kawakami, who has been murdered and dismembered. Shocked by the announcement of her death, the class is puzzled by the cruel fate that has befallen someone so dear to them; such a radiant and beautiful girl did not deserve such a hideous demise. However, a strikingly familiar student suddenly appears at the classroom's entrance. Gorgeous, slender, and with a beauty mark under her left eye, Tomie smiles and apologizes for being late.\u000a\u000aBut this is just the beginning of the mysteries surrounding this seemingly inhuman woman. The men unlucky enough to catch her eye become smitten with her instantly, but also become driven by a dark impulse to dismember her, one they often succumb to. And each time, Tomie returns from the dead to continue her favorite pastime: toying with men.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VProfessor Kawato is the new Japanese teacher in the ill-famed Futagotamaga high shool, whose baseball club is composed by thugs and bullies who have been suspended for a year from all school competitions for causing a brawl during an official match. Now that the suspension is over, the only club's members left are interested only in women, smoking and doing nothing until, under professor Kawato guidance, they discover a new dream called Koushien. The road to Koushien is far from easy, as they have to get back in shape, to learn how to play baseball and to win everyone else mistrust, including the principal's and other professor's one, with only a few months available. Sweating and fighting, the baseball club will find his determination and strength, as they proceed towards their dreams, while Kawato's enthusiastic and non-conventional ways slowly change the attitude of everyone near them.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

She needs to be strong -- Oosugi, the one man she's ever loved, is a married man; her mother is terminally ill; and her father, Einosuke, has not been home in over a year. When at last Einosuke returns, it's with a notebook full of Chinese scribblings that seem more important to him than the death of his wife. Furious, Takiko steals away his completed translation -- "The Universe of the Four Gods" -- with the intention of tearing it to shreds, but the instant she opens it, she's surrounded by light... And it is said that this is how the legend of the Priestess of Genbu began. \u000a\u000a(Source: ShoujoMagic)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 6: Ayashi no Ceres Gaiden

VLucy is a special breed of human referred to as "Diclonius," born with a short pair of horns and invisible telekinetic hands that lands her as a victim of inhumane scientific experimentation by the government. However, once circumstances present her an opportunity to escape, Lucy, corrupted by the confinement and torture, unleashes a torrent of bloodshed as she escapes her captors.\u000a\u000aDuring her breakout, she receives a crippling head injury that leaves her with a split personality: someone with the mentality of a harmless child possessing limited speech capacity. In this state of instability, she stumbles upon two college students, Kouta and his cousin Yuka, who unknowingly take an injured fugitive into their care, unaware of her murderous tendencies. This act of kindness will change their lives, as they soon find themselves dragged into the shadowy world of government secrecy and conspiracy.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shots:\u000aVolume 1: MOL\u000aVolume 2: Digitopolis\u000aVolume 3: Memoria\u000aVolume 5: Elfen Lied

VSeiichi Hayashi produced Sekishoku Elegy between 1969 and 1970, in the aftermath of a politically turbulent and culturally vibrant decade that promised but failed to deliver new possibilities. With a combination of sparse line work and visual codes borrowed from animation and film, the quiet melancholy lives of a young couple struggling to make ends meet are beautifully captured in this poetic masterpiece.\u000a\u000aUninvolved with the political movements of the time, Ichirou and Sachiko hope for something better, but they're no revolutionaries; their spare time is spent drinking, smoking, daydreaming, and sleeping\u2014together and at times with others. While Ichirou attempts to make a living from his comics, Sachiko's parents are eager to arrange a marriage for her, but Ichirou doesn't seem interested. Both in their relationship and at work, Ichirou and Sachiko are unable to say the things they need to say, and like any couple, at times say things to each other that they do not mean, ultimately communicating as much with their body language and what remains unsaid as with words.\u000a\u000a(Source: Drawn and Quaterly)

VTake yourself back to the 1880s where the KKK is thriving and the African American community lives in fear. The African Americans don't fear the KKK simply because they beat, rape, and kill them. No. They fear the KKK because the KKK eats them. They are the aptly named man-eaters, a kind of mix between werewolves and vampires. They consume human flesh, can shapeshift into various forms, and are practically immortal. Only one man, an ex-heavyweight boxer named Victor Freeman, dares to stand up to them. Equipped with a small arsenal and a set of modified brass knuckles, can our hero defend his people and avenge his past?

VA rather morbid, sombre story about two high school students\u2014Kamiyama Itsuki and Morino Yoru\u2014who have a peculiar interest in death; especially in murders that are committed close to them. Due to their strong fascination with murder and highly-developed analytical skills (along with some luck), they manage to solve the murders that have eluded even the authorities. Often, it is Kamiyama that solves the bulk of the crimes, down to the smallest of details. But there's only one thing he is interested in; by which method should Morino be killed.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

For recently turned vampire Minato Misaki, vampirism and the beastly powers that come with it are something that she wouldn't wish upon her worst enemy, let alone her beloved Kuroe. But Kuroe's supernatural investigations make him a regular target of not only vampires but of all sorts of undead creatures of the night. The only way to save him from these deadly threats may be to do the one thing that Misaki fears the most: to turn Kuroe into a vampire for his own protection\u000a\u000a(Source: Seven Seas)

VWhat happens when love gets in the way of fate? Sometimes it's funny, but it's ALWAYS bewildering. A long time ago, a group of friends banded together \u2013 and now the whole gang has been reincarnated in the present day. Each has a reminder of the past: a butterfly-shaped birthmark on their thumb. When the marks touch, they catch a glimpse of their shared past, though what they see doesn't always match. Tsubame insists that he and Kanoko are fated to be together. By the time Kanoko finds out it's not true, it's too late: she's already fallen for him. (Source: CMX)\u000a\u000aIn Oyayubihime Infinity, the "butterfly" friends try to reconcile their ties to the past with their present desire for fun and romance.

VVolume 1 : The Laughing Vampire.\u000aWhile a young boy, just resurrected as a vampire, commits acts of awful ferocity, the city around him shows all its perversion. The adults abuse their power, the boys degenerate and use all the available means to achieve their goal to give vent to their low instincts. Whoever can't understand and make opposition is doomed to change or becoming crazy. So which is the real horror? The vampire who kills in order to feed himself or the crawling disease hidden in society, which slowy corrupts without being noticed?\u000a\u000aVolume 2 : Paradise.\u000aFollowing the events narrated in the first volume, Luna and Konosuke are now living together with the old woman vampire as fellows, as lovers, in a diabolic innocence, killing for quieting their thirst for blood, joining death and love under the dream of eternal youth. Meanwhile, a young boy named Makoto is looking for his lost sister Miko, who disappeared years ago in mysterious circumstances. But what really happened to that girl who liked eating grubs and dreamed of becoming one of them? And is there really a terrible secret that someone is hiding? The paths of all the characters will dramatically collide, bringing unexpected consequences after the things are gradually revealed.\u000a\u000aA story suspended between weirdness and decadence, showing a clear nostalgia for German cinematography and Federico Fellini, where blood is used to trace a great and only apparently amoral story. \u000a\u000a(Source: MangaUpdates)

VThere is a legend that tells of how the world was almost destroyed thousands of years ago by the vampire queen after she unleashed her latent powers. Despite their efforts, the humans were unable to defeat her, and thus resorted to sealing her away until the time came that they would be powerful enough to destroy the seal and kill her. However, the humans are not the only ones after the seal. Having cast aside his kingdom and betraying his own race and the dhampirs (half-vampires), the vampire king is persistantly searching, even to this day, for where his queen has been sealed away so he may break the seal and free her before the humans do. Fearing that once the king and queen are reunited, they shall continue to destroy the world together, the humans and dhampirs hunt the king, using any method possible.\u000a\u000a(Source: Anime Source)

After Kenichi witnesses Miu's skills in martial arts, he joins the Ryouzanpaku dojo, the gathering place of those who are truly strong, which also happens to be Miu's home. After beating a karate student in a match, he is soon targeted by all the delinquents in the school.

VIs this desire for freedom the very thing that entrapped us.\u000a\u000aLet Dai is a tragic tale of forbidden love and unforgivable betrayal. Set in a soulless neo-Seoul ruled by young punks and pleasure seekers, an amoral teenager named Dai is the living embodiment of the city's beauty and cruelty. As the leader of the vicious Furies gang, Dai seduces everyone who lays eyes on him, only to blind them to his own barbaric nature. When an honest schoolboy named Jaehee rescues a beautiful girl from being mugged by the Furies, he can't possibly realize how this brief encounter will plunge him into a downward spiral of unbridled passion and unfathomable pain. From his brutal gang initiation to an unspeakable act committed against his girlfriend, Jaehee wavers uncomfortably between revulsion and fascination. And in Dai he finds a tender, caring friend one moment and a heartless sociopath the next, awakening strange and unhealthy desires in Jaehee that he could never before have imagined.\u000a\u000a(Source: Netcomics)

Currently, there are two units in the world, both in Japan; one white unit and one darker, black unit. The eye style, according to Asamiya, "Is a mono-eye style.... but there's actually two eyes."

It seems her father's company is having difficulty, so in order to save it, he set up an arranged marriage between Nao and the son of a wealthy man. Nao isn't exactly happy to hear this news. To make things even more fun, Nao is attending a new high school. Up to this point, she had only attended all-girls schools. Her new school was an all-boys school up to this year, so it is about 95% guys! Nao knows that her new fiance is a student there, but she hasn't been told exactly WHO it is! Right away Nao meets two interesting guys at school. They are the somewhat surly Sakaki Mitsuru, and the very pretty boy Toono Minori. Nao actually thought Minori was a girl at first, and was rather shocked to discover he is a guy. Nao is trying to figure out which guy at the school is her fiance, but she doesn't have much to go on, only 5 hints: 1.) One of his initials is "M" 2.) He has a mole somewhere near his hip 3.) He has a flower-shaped birthmark 4.) She met him when she was a child 5.) Fear of high places.\u000a\u000aThe hunt is on as Nao cheerfully searches for her new fiance. More than one boy seems to fit her clues, how will she ever figure out who it is?\u000a

VHailed as the savior of the Japanese Police Department, high school detective Shinichi Kudou uses a combination of observational skills, critical thinking, and all-around knowledge to solve cases that leave the police stumped.\u000a\u000aOne day, while at an outing with childhood friend Ran Mouri, Shinichi bears witness to a suspicious transaction between two men and is caught. As a result, he is forced to ingest a poison that is supposed to kill him, but unexpectedly shrinks his body to the size of a grade-schooler instead. Now believed to be dead, Shinichi takes up the alias of Conan Edogawa (a compound of the names of the famous mystery authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa) in order to hide his identity and begins his new life as a seven-year-old living with Ran and her private detective father.\u000a\u000aMeitantei Conan follows Conan as he continues to solve murder cases, all while slowly working toward exposing the men who shrunk him and eventually restoring his body.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VYokodera is just like every teenage boy: perversion is in his nature. He can't help but look up girls' skirts and fantasize about them. However, in his case, every time he does something perverted, it somehow gets turned around and misunderstood as something positive for the community. Sick of being so perverted, he tries to shake free of it by going to a special part of town. On top of a hill, away from the town and at the foot of a large tree, there is a wooden sculpture of a beckoning cat that is said to have special powers. Instead of bringing a wish to the user like a typical beckoning cat, it takes something from the user, and, in Yokodera's case, his perversion. Still doubtful, he uses the beckoning cat thinking that it couldn't hurt to try, but, little does he know, his life is about to make a turn to the unexpected.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VHole\u2014a dark, decrepit, and disorderly district where the strong prey on the weak and death is an ordinary occurrence\u2014is all but befitting of the name given to it. A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.\u000a\u000aPossessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most\u2014aside for a few. Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restore his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\u000a\u000aSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VPopular high school student Suwa Daisuke has no interest in dating newcomer Aikawa Hinako, a quiet loner. That's because she recoiled from his flirtatious touch, and he took it as a personal affront. Daisuke informs one of his buddies that he wouldn't date her, not knowing Hinako was listening. Daisuke's attitude changes after he accidentally hears her confession in an abandoned church; she's been sexually abused by her stepfather and has given up a child for adoption. His former annoyance turns to compassion and concern. Hinako is unaware that he knows her terrible secret. Believing him to have no romantic interest, she becomes more relaxed and comfortable in his company. Their relationship faces a lot of obstacles, including jealous classmates.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

VKou Kitamura is a fifth grader whose family runs a sporting goods store. One of the regular customers of his family's store is the Tsukishima Batting Center, and so he gets to know the four daughters of the Tsukishima family (Ichiyo, Wakaba, Aoba, and Momiji) very well. Since Kou has spent so much time practicing in their batting cages, he has become a genius hitter, but has no knowledge of any other aspect of baseball. This is in contrast to Aoba, who, despite being a year younger, is an adept pitcher and hitter. Wakaba is a classmate of Kou's, and she seems fully intent on marrying him when she grows up. All seems idyllic in their world, until tragedy strikes. The story then skips ahead to four years later, as Kou has continued the training he began four years ago, but has not played in a baseball game since. As he finally begins playing again, it remains to be seen whether or not he will live up to the expectations of those who know the true talent he has been hiding all this time.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

VRaizo Fuwa is a 25-year-old salaryman living in a cramped home and working in a crowded office in Tokyo. His hopes for improved conditions are dashed when the new office building his company is supposed to move into is condemned as unsafe because the construction company has been cutting corners. Since the old building is already being demolished, they have no choice but to "temporarily" move the office into Fuwa's new flat. The final complication arrives in the form of the new employee Izumi Hiyama, a high school dropout the boss has promised to take care of as a favor to her family. No landlords are willing to rent to a 15-year-old girl, so she too has to move into Fuwa's home/office.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

VSawa Rakan is a normal high school student living a quiet life alone, tending to his many lush plants. This peace is disrupted when a foreign man and several dangerous creatures suddenly crash into his garden. The man immediately turns his odd plant-like weapon on Rakan, but after seeing it respond to Rakan's touch, his attitude completely changes. The man, Chigusa, declares that Rakan is a precious "sanome," a person who can cultivate plant life at will.\u000a\u000aBeing the last known sanome, Chigusa vows to protect Rakan at all costs and asks for his support. Chigusa is an infamous outlaw that aims to destroy the "ayame," creatures that siphon life from his dying world, including the current prince who oddly looks exactly like Rakan.\u000a\u000aRakan travels to Chigusa's desert world that is filled with despondent people, strange creatures, spirits, and magic. Along the way, they gather more followers and supporters in their quest to return green to the barren, decaying land.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VYukiya Ayase is a gentle, kind hearted, and innocent university student. The only relative he has left, his cousin Tetsuo, betrays Ayase by selling him to the highest bidder in an auction with hopes of making an enormous profit to be able to pay off his debts. Somuku Kanou, a bad-tempered (though very rich) loan shark, comes to Ayase's rescue and buys Ayase for an impressive 1.2 billion. Kanou apparently knows Ayase from something that happened between them in the past, but Ayase cannot remember who Kanou is nor does he understand why he "saved" him. In a desperate effort to keep Ayase close to him, Kanou demands the debt be repaid in full and suggests the perfect way to do it: by selling his body to Kanou for 500,000 each time. Ayase is horrified in the beginning, but something soon begins to grow between them that can't be bought for any price.

Because he feels he has nothing to live for, he let himself go, becoming fat, miserable, and lonely. The only shining thing he lives for is the occasional visit to a brothel where his savings will allow him to at least not be completely sexless. This is when, through a real life friend of his, he is introduced to the virtual reality world of "The Unreal." Where, after spending $6000+ on equipment, you can purchase a virtual girlfriend who only thinks of you. Only the girl, Tsukiko, that Takurou purchases, seems to have come with a few defects.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

As Keiichi settles in, he meets some local girls who quickly become his steadfast group of friends: Satoko Houjou, Rika Furude, Rena Ryuuguu, and Mion Sonozaki. While their life is mostly carefree and fun-filled, he begins to discover that things in Hinamizawa are not as they appear to be.\u000a\u000aDuring the annual Cotton Drifting Festival, Keiichi learns that there have been murders and disappearances for the past few years in the aftermath of the celebration.

Koshiro first encounters Nanoka on the train one morning, and returns her dropped train pass. Despite their age difference, they feel a brief spark of connection before they go their separate ways.\u000a\u000aSoon after that, they encounter each other once again near an amusement park, where they go on an impromptu date.

VA messenger of the Heavens has arrived in Zhao Ge, which has been ruled by the Shang dynasty for generations. The current emperor, Zi Zhou, refuses to bow his head before the gods, and declares to the messenger that he will no longer accept the tyranny of the Heavens. The gods do not take this kindly; and soon, the emperor of a neighboring land, Wu Jifa, leads a crusade against the rebelling Shang.\u000a\u000aDuring the battle, the Shang forces are vastly overwhelmed, and just when the capital is inches away from being taken, Zhou joins the fight. Although he breaks through the enemy ranks and makes his way toward Jifa, out of nowhere a god falls from the sky, landing right before him, prepared to personally deal with the troublemaker.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

In order to appease the wrath of the beast, the children decide to offer it a sacrifice: The unfortunate Arie, whom they believe to be the cause of the curse, is shoved into a well that leads to the Nijigahara tunnel\u2014an act that in turns pushes Komatsuzaki, the budding thug who has carried a torch for Arie for a while already, entirely over the edge.\u000a\u000aBut this is only the beginning of the complex, challenging, obliquely told Nijigahara Holograph, which takes place in two separate timeliness and involves the suicidal Suzuki; Higure, his stalker-ish would-be girlfriend; their teacher Miss Sakaki, whose heavily bandaged face remains a mystery; and many more\u2015brothers, sisters, parents, co-workers, teachers, aggressors and victims who are all inextricably linked to one another and all will eventually\u2015ten years later\u2015have to live with what they've done or suffered through.\u000a\u000a(Source: Fantagraphics)

The mean look everyone thinks she gives is just her not knowing how to smile. The scary comments she makes is only because Sotomura isn't good at expressing her feelings or taken way out of context.

Not wanting to go on with life like this, Sotomura tries to change her image, but the more she does, the more her reputation becomes more set into stone.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VKaimei High School is full of eccentric individuals, students, and teachers alike. Amongst the school's many clubs is the SKET Brigade, officially known as the Living Assistance Club. Comprised of the somewhat idiotic Yuusuke "Bossun" Fujisaki, the gallant Hime "Himeko" Onizuka, and the silent but surprisingly popular Kazuyoshi "Switch" Usui, the SKET Brigade is dedicated to solving various problems on campus. However, the club rarely receives requests, so the members spend most of their time messing around with random, trivial matters. Both hilarious and heartwarming, SKET Dance is a lighthearted comedy following the daily high school lives of an odd trio of friends.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VKimi wa Girlfriend is about a girl named Hatsune with a "bad mouth," for lack of a better description. She's kind-hearted, but her mouth spews the total opposite of what she means (which is probably due to the fact that she grew up with only male influence). Thus, she is seen as an arrogant, vulgar girl at her school, but all she wants is a boyfriend. Well, that is, until she gets accepted at the Maidens' Club, where she meets a guy named Kirie, with a somewhat unique habit that happens when a girl comes within a foot of him. Everyone says he's gay, even Hatsune.\u000a\u000aHow will these two fare? Will Hatsune have a boyfriend at last? Will he be more than just a friend?\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VDemons exist and their power is beyond what humans can fathom. In fact they are so strong that humans do not stand a chance against them in a fight. The only thing strong enough to defeat a demon is another demon and it is through this logic that Ryo Asuka hatches the plan to have his good-hearted friend Akira Fudo possessed by a demon. If a person is of pure of heart then he might be able to control the demon that possesses him and thereby acquire power equal to a demon. After raising some hell in a club the plan works and Akira is possessed by the powerful demon known as Amon. Now Akira is mankind's sole champion of justice against the hidden demon menace that has plagued humanity since the dawn of time.

VThe story, which takes place in the fictional medieval empire of Saiunkoku, follows the adventures of Shuurei Kou, a descendant of a noble family that has fallen on hard times. Her father serves as librarian in the Imperial palace, a post which offers prestige and respect but little compensation. Shuurei teaches in the temple school and works odd jobs to make ends meet, but her dream is to pass the imperial examinations and take a post in government, a path forbidden to women. Shuurei's plans come to an abrupt halt when the Emperor's Grand Advisor makes a startling offer: join the imperial household for six months as the young Emperor's consort, and teach the Emperor to be a responsible ruler. If she succeeds, the financial reward will be great. The story details Shuurei's growing relationships with the Emperor and other members of the court, the intrigues that surround imperial politics, and Shuurei's commitment to better herself and her country.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

Most of the other kids mock Yuki, who they think is crazy due to his strange pronouncements and peculiar actions, and, aside from the creatures he sees, his only social interactions are with the school's kindly and open-minded caretaker, a new transfer student named Makoto Suzuki who's allocated the desk next to his and an enigmatic boy named IQ who always wears a box over his head. \u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

With no end in sight to her reign of terror, the people elect a hero to vanquish the Demon Queen and her monster kin. However, the chosen hero, Exa, is not exactly humanity's champion: he values not only human lives but those of monsters as well.\u000a\u000aDuring his journey, the idealistic Exa saves a monster girl from a dragon, completely unaware that this girl is the Demon Queen herself. Intrigued by a human who would save one of his species' enemies, Sheila poses as a meek, lovestruck monster and joins him on his journey\u2014all while planning to stab him in the back.

He works with his little assistant Pinoko (who has a massive crush on the doctor), dealing with medical cases not very well known, which can be strange, dangerous, or not known at all. But he is a genius, and can save almost any of his patients' lives (as long as they have the money for it, that is), and is known to many around the world, especially to those of medicine and science. He's a man of science himself, and does not believe much until he has seen it, yet it is many times he is surprised by love and nature often overpowering the science he bases his life in.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

VThere is a magic love app that supposedly helps people's dreams of love come true. The first story of this love app follows Tetta and Ginko, friends who have bickered since grade school. Tetta looks up the magic app on a whim, and ends up with an application that is connected to Ginko. When he manipulates the "Ginko" on the app, it affects the real girl. He's embarrassed to have it in the first place, but he can't uninstall it without inputting Ginko's measurements. Whether he actually likes Ginko romantically or not, it seems that this app could only make the situation worse!\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 3: Keetai Shoujo

VAfter a night of drunken revelry, 19-year-old Kouta Satou decides to relieve himself near a seemingly secluded temple. Meanwhile, an angel is attempting to seal the queen of the underworld into a holy ball with his bow. Unfortunately, he misfires, trapping her instead inside of Kouta's unwitting balls. The angel departs, leaving Kouta a dire warning: if he fails to resist ejaculating before the end of the month, the queen will be released and mark the end of the world.\u000a\u000aFor the lustful Kouta, such a commitment is easier said than done; on top of using any means necessary to resist temptation, he must also guard himself from advances made by Elyse, a lesser devil who would resort to drastic measures to free her queen. In Oretama, the fate of the entire world rests upon the improbability of one man's chastity.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aNote: There are five specials: Extra Ball 1-3 and Special Ball 1 & 2 are coupled with the tankoubon releases.

VTsutsui Hikari is an otaku, and he mostly avoids social life. Hikari has only one friend at school, who is also a social misfit, and he is mocked brutally by most of his classmates for being creepy and weird. One day, he ends up having to clean the school pool with Igarashi Iroha, who appears to be pretty much everything he hates in real-life girls. She skips school, has a blunt manner, doesn't have female friends, and seems the sort to be promiscuous. However, she is friendly to Hikari, and even stands up to the people who make fun of him. Hikari's bitterness and trust issues lead him to say pretty harsh things to Iroha, but she never dismisses him as creepy. After a while, it starts to look like Iroha may become his first real-life, 3D girlfriend! Will he be able to handle it?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

Those behind this are called the Ame No Tori (Rain of Birds), but it all turns out to be a plot against humanity where the new technology can take over its host, thus turning them into a killing machine.

VWishing she would live up to the ideal, Kanzaki Nao's father named her thusly for "honesty." Nao has more than lived up to her father's wishes\u2014even exceeding them and earning the label of "a foolishly honest girl." This makes Nao the least qualified candidate for the high stakes "Liar Game," where winning requires deceiving the opponent out of their money and losing means receiving massive debt; however, that doesn't stop a box containing a hundred million yen in cash and a card informing her of her participation in the game from arriving at her doorstep, nor does it stop her from being promptly tricked out of the entire sum of money. Upon hearing that a genius swindler, responsible for the bankruptcy of a major corporation, is being released from jail, Nao goes to the swindler, Shinichi Akiyama, to enlist his help. With that, the two are drawn into the dark, greed-filled, and deceptive world of the Liar Game.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VAgeha and her sister Hana are twins. At birth, their parents left Ageha in the care of their grandmother in the countryside. Hana was raised in the big city with her parents. However, when the girls were in first grade, their grandmother became ill and so, Ageha was sent to live with her parents and her twin sister in the city.\u000a\u000aThe two girls are in high school now, and are complete opposites. Growing up in the countryside has made Ageha a bit of a tomboy; she's a quiet, reserved girl who doesn't look anything special. Hana, on the other hand, is outgoing, gorgeous and popular at school. Regardless, the two girls appear to have a stable, good relationship with one another.\u000a\u000aOne day when all of Ageha's classmates leave to attend a concert, Ageha finds herself alone to maintain the booth at school during the school fair. Ageha feels as if she's Cinderella who didn't get invited to go to the ball. Just when she was thinking those thoughts, a boy wearing a horse mask on his head runs into the classroom and hides underneath a table. His name is Kyuu. It turns out he's being chased by some girls. After the girls leave, Ageha is startled by Kyuu who demands that she serve him coffee. As she does so, Kyuu flips through her agenda booklet and discovers a photograph of Ageha and the boy she has a crush on, Ryuusei, who she has known from childhood but since they moved away, they have forgotten each other. Kyuu asks if she likes Ryuusei, and if she wants to be Ryuusei's girlfriend in a teasing sort of way, causing much embarrassment to the girl. Kyuu then tells her that if she believes in her heart that it is possible, it could come true. Kyuu tells her to shout out that she's Ryuusei's girlfriend and that they are going out and her life is very good, which Ageha does so. As soon as she speaks the words, Ryuusei appears at the classroom door, and recognizes Ageha as the girl from his childhood that he used to play with. Ageha secretly thinks of Kyuu as Cinderella's fairy godmother and cannot believe that it happened.\u000a\u000aHowever, as Ageha and Ryuusei rekindle a friendship from long ago, Hana becomes suspicious or jealous of Ageha's relationship with Ryuusei. She becomes especially annoyed when she finds out that Ryuusei prefers Ageha to her. Hana then begins to formulate a plan to steal Ryuusei away from Ageha.

She was on a path to self-destruction until she realized that she needed to live for herself and fill the voids in her heart.\u000a\u000aOne of those voids happens to be the loving embrace by a woman, i.e. her mother, so on the whim, she schedules a hotel date with a female sex worker.

Then during lunch one day she suddenly announces to her friend Mitsue that she had become a goddess the night before.

VIt's not that she tries to keep to herself, exactly: It's just that everyone seems to look right through her! Naturally, Sakuya Tohno has a complex about it. She says she's just like air: ever present, but never seen. All she wants is a friend, but building relationships isn't exactly easy for someone who is, for all intents and purposes, invisible. But then she hears a legend about the "Thousand-Year Sakura" and how, if one makes a wish beneath its perpetually-blossoming boughs, it's sure to come true. So in a moment of desperation, she races to the tree, only to find four very attractive boys waiting for her... And at that moment, beneath the cherry blossoms of the ever-blooming Thousand-Year Sakura, something incredible happens!\u000a\u000a(Source: Turtle Paradise)

VKaito Kuroba, a normal teenage student whose father is often absent. When his father dies under mysterious circumstances, he is made aware of his father's secret identity; a famous international criminal known as International Criminal 1412: the Phantom Thief, and that he was murdered by a mysterious organization for refusing to aid them in retrieving the "Pandora Gem"; a mystical stone said to shed a "tear" during the passing of a particular comet (often called the 'Volley Comet'), the consumption of which bestows immortality. He vows to prevent the organization from gaining immortality, and assumes his father's identity as he begins his quest for the gem. His only clues as to the gem's location are that it glows red under the full moon and that it is a doublet: a gem hidden within a larger gem. Thus, it would have to be a relatively large one with a bizarre history, and always stored in a place that never receives moonlight. He thus researches and steals famous priceless gems with odd histories from incredibly well-defended areas, and always returns them after the very next full moon.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

VTamiya Nika is a beautiful, outgoing, popular high school girl. She has just the right look, just the right fashions, and is everyone's friend. What everyone at school does not know is how hard Nika works to keep up this perfect image, and what she is REALLY like at home. When not at school, Nika is a scary, sloppy, tight-fisted girl who wears glasses, an ugly sweatsuit, and has her hair pulled back into unattractive buns. She lays around playing video games and reading manga. Her attitude is bossy and cranky, and she travels far out of her way to shop where she won't be recognized.\u000a\u000aEvery day, Nika "Switches On" with a strict regimen of beautification that involves primping and plucking and careful dressing. The only person who knows about Nika's Switched On/Off modes is her best friend, who is also aware of the reasons behind the changes.\u000a\u000aHowever, soon a second person finds about about Nika's personalities - someone who has his own On/Off switch, but in reverse! His name is Kamiyama Arata, and he is a recent transfer student. He meets Nika when she is in OFF Mode, and then again at school when she is ON. However Nika can see that he has his little secret. At school, Arata wears thick swirly-eyed glasses and messy hair that make some bullies think he is an otaku. However, at home, he ditches the glasses and is downright gorgeous! He is just the opposite of Nika, but why?\u000a\u000a(Source: MANGAtoshokan)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 3: Switch Girl!! (pilot)

She also reveals that he was sent here to destroy humanity, on a whim of his father Beelzebub III, Great Demon Lord of the Demon World.

VEver since the day Ran Kurono's older brother was killed while protecting Sei Ohtori, she has dedicated her skills and life to one day becoming the First Knight of the next head of the Ohtori family, even concealing the fact that she's a woman forever. For generations the Kurono family has served the Ohtori family as their First Knight, but 11 other lower knights with ill intentions of using the Ohtori family's authority vie for that title. Not only that, but Sei is being tested for being suitable for the title of head of the family. Upon entering Saint Locks Academy, the days of both Ran and Sei's trials begin, all the while being helped by Sei's untidy and unrefined fiance, Ibara Tennou. \u000a\u000a(Source: Taciturnity Scans)

The Hero explains how the war that the demons have brought upon the humans have killed thousands and put more in misery. The queen of demons however argues that this war has made the human society band together as one and showed empirical evidence how it has increased population, increased production, boosted economy and improved society overall. Furthermore, she explains to the Hero that ending this war will result in a civil war that will produce more bloodshed than there ever was. The Hero, convinced that the only way to bring peace, relatively speaking, is to join forces with the Dark Lady, agrees to help with her plans!\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 12: Level Hero!

VI am a knight. To be precise, I am the Church of the God of Light's Sun Knight. The Church of the God of Light worships and serves the God of Light, and theirs is one of the three largest religions on this continent. As the whole continent knows, the Church of the God of Light has twelve holy knights and each one has his own unique personality and features. To be the Sun Knight is to have shining golden hair, sky blue eyes, a compassionate nature, and a brilliant smile.\u000a\u000a"The benevolent God of Light will forgive your sins."\u000a\u000aI must have said that line at least a million times in my time as the Sun Knight. However, the greatest wish in my life is to be able to stand before the entire continent and roar, "Damn your 'the whole continent knows'! This Sun Knight just doesn't feel like smiling! I just don't want to forgive these human trashes! I just want to pepper my sentences with 'f***'!"\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, even to this day, I continue to wear a smile as I say, "The benevolent God of Light will forgive your sins."\u000a\u000a(Source: HalfPrince)

VThis story introduces Takeru who is an average Japanese highschool girl raised in a Buddhist convent by nuns. She has been experiencing reoccurring nightmares about the Witchblade calling out to her. This is due to the secret that the temple houses within, the Witchblade sealed inside a box. Furthermore, her lineage keeps an unknown connection with the mystic artifact and the folklore of the Oni, hence explaining Takeru's strong attraction to the gauntlet which is locally called Oni no te (\u9b3c\u306e\u624b, "Hand of Oni"). Ultimately, Takeru's life suffers a drastic change when she becomes the next bearer of the Witchblade due to some circumstances that force her to randomly encounter it.\u000a\u000aWitchblade Takeru started serial run since March 2006 in Champion Red magazine under publisher Akita Shoten. Story by Kobayashi Yasuko with art made by Sumita Kazasa, whose art and illustrations carry over an erotic style.\u000a\u000aBased on Marc Silvestri's and David Wohl's American Comic book series\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

VMeet Min Woo. A normal 18-year-old high school boy. Well...normal except for being a total otaku. He does what every good little otaku boy does. He collects figurines and toys, wins prizes at cosplay contests and is a two-time champion of the fighting game "Metal Heart." Unfortunately for him, his social life is dominated by girls telling him to get lost, since his otaku-ness might be contagious.\u000a\u000aBut after an accident while he is invited to participate in the playtesting of "Metal Heart 2," the main character to the game, Min Sia, materializes in front of his eyes at a cosplay festival. And now, Min Woo has to win Sia's heart in a real-life dating sim game with the fate of the world in the balance. Ok, so maybe not the world, but at least the fate of the company behind "Metal Heart 2" hanging in the balance. And who is this girl Nuri who appears following Sia, who claims to be Min Woo's childhood friend...\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VIn a prison world, there are few good stories, and this is the world of Kubikiri Asa, the beheader and master samurai under the Shogun. It's a world full of vengeance, greed, and violence. A world of depravity and sin. One man can set things straight if he can keep his wits. This is a story of extreme proportions, of sword study thick in tradition and with grim purpose, of blood rivers, agonizing screams, bondage, torture, and the evil prevalent in human failure. Drafted by the confirmed masters of the international medium of manga, Samurai Executioner is a shocking combination of darkness and fire, fine lines, and a fine man in the face of human decline.\u000a\u000a(Source: Dark Horse)

VOn August 10, 2019, Earth received a signal, which was confirmed by hundreds of different scientists to be from an alien life form. The message: "Let us meet on Mars on July 7, 2035". With this, a space agency representing all of Earth was formed, named ST&RS. From there on, many different events occurred quite quickly, such as the re-landing of people on the moon in 2022 and the construction of many new space stations. Later on, the Space Academy was founded as a way to train upcoming generations of ST&RS.\u000a\u000aAlso on August 10 of 2019, the same day that Earth received the message from the alien life form, a young boy named Shirafune Maho uttered his first word, and the word was "Mars." Ever since that moment, Maho has been obsessed with astronomy, and the only thing that he has on his mind is the universe. He decides at an early age that he will apply to the Space Academy to train to become an astronaut, along with his childhood friend, Hishihara Meguru, and a transfer student and genius classmate, Amachi Wataru. The newfound trio begins a seemingly impossible journey to get accepted into an academy where all applicants only have a 1% chance of being accepted into the Space Academy.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

V"Boys are creatures whose sight will follow the girl they like wherever she is. And if there it comes the chance that the boy realizes that the girl is in danger, if he is able to save her they will feel the ultimate bliss in life" is something that Harisugawa Tetsu has pointed out, and true enough he has always been following with his eyes the girl named Satomi Mao.\u000a\u000aThanks to certain details in their childhood, Satomi has always been friendly with Harisugawa and she has a friendly budding relationship, completely unaware of Tetsu's feelings for her. Tetsu for his part preferred to play the friend part and keeps his feelings hidden for the sake of not endangering the closeness that they already have, ever since he was young Tetsu had believed that if he can build little by little a good relationship with Mao, he will get to the point where he can confidently confess to Mao and not get rejected, Tetsu has always been waiting for his one true chance without getting too close to Mao by accident.\u000a\u000aAt first it seems that this "stalemate" will never be broken; however, one day Mao sees a strange mirror in an thrift store and for some reason she feels that she must have that mirror. Mao buys the mirror without thinking twice about it.... But she is completely unaware that the mirror will change forever Tetsu's life as well as her own. \u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

The King of Ah took on a wife from Kou and soon thereafter one from Do, creating a shaky alliance between the three nations. When the Second Queen gave birth to a son, the King cast aside the sickly First Queen and her daughter Aki into the depths of the Palace. But as Fate would have it, Princess Aki encounters a slave named Hakusei, who has peculiar golden hair and sky blue eyes. He promises his life to her and helps her train in the Six Arts under the guidance of the enigmatic merchant Seitetsu; however, when Aki outshines the Prince during a hunt in an attempt to gain her father's acknowledgement, she sparks a war by besmirching Do's honor and drives the Second Queen to poison her mother.\u000a\u000aWith nothing left but her faithful Hakusei, Aki is banished to the small country of Kou with a vow to return to Ah one day for revenge. But in the face of the mighty allied nations of Do and Ah, will the two survive long enough to carry out Aki's vow?\u000a\u000a(Source: Transcendence)

VImamura Kinichiro reluctantly wakes up one day to attend his high school graduation. He'd made no friends in high school and joined no clubs. Everyone was afraid of him, due to his long blond hair and surly attitude. Reflecting on his awful high school years, he remembers a girl from the Japanese cheering squad that he saw in the welcome ceremony three years ago. Searching for the old cheering squad's clubroom, he accidentally startles a classmate, causing them both to fall down a flight of stairs...\u000a\u000aWhen he wakes up, it's the morning of his first day of high school, three years ago. As he confusedly goes through his day, he's able to correct a lot of the mistakes he made the first time around, such as actually interacting with the cheering squad girl, Usami Yoshiko! But did he really travel in time, or is this all just a dream he's having while his body is lying unconscious somewhere? Could he really have the chance to go through his high school years again?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VOne day, a four-year-old boy came to a sudden realization: the world is not fair. Eighty percent of the world's population wield special abilities, known as "quirks," which have given many the power to make their childhood dreams of becoming a superhero a reality. Unfortunately, Izuku Midoriya was one of the few born without a quirk, suffering from discrimination because of it. Yet, he refuses to give up on his dream of becoming a hero; determined to do the impossible, Izuku sets his sights on the elite hero training academy, UA High.\u000a\u000aHowever, everything changes after a chance meeting with the number one hero and Izuku's idol, All Might. Discovering that his dream is not a dead end, the powerless boy undergoes special training, working harder than ever before. Eventually, this leads to him inheriting All Might's power, and with his newfound abilities, gets into his school of choice, beginning his grueling journey to become the successor of the best hero on the planet.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VBecause of a hearing disability, Kouhei is often misunderstood and has trouble integrating into life on campus, so he learns to keep his distance. That is until he meets the outspoken and cheerful Taichi. He tells Kouhei that his hearing loss is not his fault. Taichi's words cut through Kouhei's usual defense mechanisms and open his heart. More than friends, less than lovers, their relationship changes Kouhei forever.\u000a\u000a(Source: One Peace Books)

VHatou Gaku has a very odd friend at school named Marii Yukari. Yukari has purple eyes and a bizarre way of looking at the world: she sees all living things as robots. This has not always worked out well for Yukari, even costing her a best friend when she was younger. However, Yukari insists that the things she says she sees is true, and her vision seems to give her insight into the abilities of others.\u000a\u000aGaku thinks she's just weird, but she soon realizes that Yukari has unexpected talents. It seems she can fix anything, and even the police come to hear her insights. It turns out that Yukari's purple eyes are not unique in the world! However, there is one important distinction among those who see humans as other objects. Do humans appear as unimportant as objects, or do those objects appear as important as human beings?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VA Byouma is a medical weapon created by ancient sorcerers to kill the infected or those around the infected and make it look like an illness. Even centuries after the sorcerers have died, these weapons still wander the world, infecting and killing people. Narutaki Soutarou and Izumo Momo are Shadow Doctors, trained to combat these Byouma through unorthodox means. Using magically created anti-Byouma medical equipment, they perform "operations" on the medical weapons to separate them from their hosts and destroy them. Will their special weapons and brilliant teamwork be enough to get rid of all the Byouma in the world?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VJigokumeguri Haru is the heiress of one of the largest business empires in all of Japan. She is not only rich, but also practically a celebrity. However, partly because of her heritage and partly because of her arrogant and aloof behavior, she has always been isolated from her peers and has never been able to make friends. Thus, she has\u2014without success so far\u2014transferred from school to school to finally find a place where she would be accepted.\u000a\u000aThis only begins to change when she meets her new classmate Kawayanagi Tsurezure, an outcast weirdo that dresses in 20th century fashion, talks little and smiles even less. Being both somewhat socially awkward, they thus begin an unexpected friendship.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VNo matter what age it is, bullying will never disappear. The overweight, middle school student, Haruyuki, was one such kid. The only time he could relax completely, was when he would play a squash game on the local network the school had set up. He loved playing this simple game as he can forget painful times while immersed in it.\u000a\u000aIt was fall. He was passing his time like this until one day, he had an encounter with the school's most beautiful, refined girl, "Snow Black," which changed his life abruptly. Introduced to the software she transmitted, Haruyuki learned about "Accel World." A program that enhances one's mind capabilities, with certain side-effects.\u000a\u000aIt was the moment the guy on the lowest rung at school became "Burst Linker," protecting the Princess as her knight.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU, edited)

On the other hand, all of Mikako Nagao's classmates believe she is sweet and pure; but in contrast to her innocent veneer, she enjoys selling her body to older men while pretending to be 15 years old.

To ease his troubled state, Mugi takes a summer job at his friend Kazuki's beach-side snack bar/hotel on a tropical island. It seems like the perfect plan-until Kazuki sets Mugi up on a date with Yuu, who's supposed to be, well, a little less than perfect. When Yuu arrives, however, she's not the monster that either of the boys had imagined. In fact, Yuu is about the cutest person that Mugi has ever seen. But after Mugi accidentally walks in on Yuu in the bath, the girl is steamed. When trying to apologize the next day, he discovers that Yuu has left the shores of paradise.

VHaving lost his parents, eight-year-old Yuuichirou Amane is taken in by the Hyakuya Orphanage, where he struggles to bond with his new "family." However, this soon becomes the least of his worries, when a major pandemic suddenly strikes, killing all above the age of 13. Taking advantage of the chaos, vampires\u2014who previously laid dormant underground\u2014rise up and enslave the surviving humans, using them as livestock to harvest blood.\u000a\u000aFour years later, Yuuichirou and his family have adjusted to life under vampire control, although Yuuichirou still aspires to kill all vampires and end their reign of terror. This often puts him at odds with fellow orphan Mikaela Hyakuya, who emphasizes using wit and ingenuity to survive. Having garnered favor among high-ranking vampires, Mikaela gains inside knowledge and uses this to plan a daring escape. But during the attempt, the group of orphans is intercepted by vampire officer Ferid Bathory, who proceeds to massacre them. Yuuichirou is the only member of the group to escape to the surface, where he is discovered by the Moon Demon Company, a military unit dedicated to hunting down vampires. Given an invitation to join, Yuuichirou swiftly accepts, finally being presented an opportunity to achieve his ambitions and avenge his family.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VOreki Houtarou is a self-proclaimed "energy-saver" - that is, he will not actively waste energy doing things that aren't necessary. Though he had no interest whatsoever in joining any clubs upon entering Kamiyama High School, he was commanded by his older sister Tomoka to enter the school's Classics Club, which was in danger of getting abolished as all previous members have graduated. Together with his old friends Fukube Satoshi and Ibara Mayaka, as well as the elegantly ladylike and curiously inquisitive Chitanda Eru, the newly reformed Classics Club find themselves involved in all sorts of mystery-solving escapades. Houtarou soon finds out that the Classics Club, as Tomoka has promised, is actually "quite interesting".\u000a\u000a(Source: Baka-Tsuki)

VShiki Yukitaka is desperate for money, but he makes way too little as a long term substitute teacher. While drinking one evening, a pretty woman asks if he would be willing to assassinate people for 5 million yen a kill. Although Shiki is hesitant, he grudgingly admits that he might do it, provided all the targets are serious evildoers. He soon finds that her offer is deadly serious, when she introduces him to the rest of the team and points them towards their first target. The driver, Yan, is doing this for the money as well. Shiki's partner, Kuzumi, is a cop. He doesn't appear to be interested in the money, but he seems to be driven by a deep anger.\u000a\u000aOn Shiki's first mission, things don't go quite as planned. They didn't count on their target's 18-year-old daughter Itsuki being locked up in the house. She's been confined for 10 years, due to her spooky ability to read things from people's minds when she touches them. She claims to want to be their ally, and Shiki is reluctantly made responsible for her care. With the police investigating their crime, is keeping her alive too dangerous? How long will the team be able to get away with continuing their highly paid vigilante murders?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VOne morning, Naho Takamiya receives a letter in the mail claiming to be from herself 10 years in the future. The letter reveals a series of events that are supposed to take place that day. At first, Naho thinks it's just a prank; but when the letter mentions a transfer student named Kakeru Naruse, who really ends up transferring into her class later that day, she is forced to believe in its contents.\u000a\u000aAs Naho continues to read the letter, her future self mentions several regrets, urging Naho to take the right decisions now. Somehow these regrets all seem to be connected to Kakeru, and with the burden of the knowledge that the boy wouldn't be with her and her friends in the future, will Naho be able to make the perfect choices that will alter what seems to be fate?\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aAlso includes Haru-iro Astronaut (Spring-Colored Astronaut) series.

VKinnikuman (a.k.a. Kinniku Suguru) is a cowardly, clumsy, moronic, gyuudon-devouring excuse for a superhero (or Choujin)... who just happens to be the prince of an alien planet. But despite his pathetic appearance, he is very honorable and can become quite powerful when he needs to be. With his sidekick Meat-kun and fellow Choujin's Terryman and Ramenman there to help him, Suguru quests to become the greatest Choujin on the planet. Whether with a combination of tremendous heart and stamina (The Burning Inner Strength) or the "Power of Friendship," Kinnikuman frequently defeats villians 10 times more powerful than him and often causes his enemies to have a change of heart and join him. Though he seems destined to be an idiot forever, slowly but surely Kinnikuman becomes worthy of the title "Hero."\u000a\u000aNote: Between volumes 36 and 37 publication there's 22 years gap. From volume 38 onwards starts restarted in 2011 version.

VThe story is set in 1949 and follows Japanese-American comic book artist Kevin Yamagata as he draws the popular detective series "Billy Bat" for "Marble Comics." When he learns he may have unconsciously copied the character from an image he saw while serving in occupied Japan, he returns to Japan to get permission to use Billy Bat from its original creator. Upon arriving there, however, he becomes embroiled in a web of murder, cover-ups, and prophecy that all leads back to Billy Bat.\u000a\u000aIt is soon evident, however, that the truth of Billy Bat's nature is far larger than Kevin could ever guess, spanning millennia and across the world.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

VLittle Rin Fujiwara hated her own face a lot. It was not until her 6th birthday that a make up box she got as a present changes her perspective completely. In front of the mirror, Rin would play with the make up, which becomes like a magic that makes her stronger. Rin believes make up can change both appearance and heart, because it gives the confidence a girl needs.\u000a\u000aYears later, Rin attends her first high school year. She decides to help other girls there to become pretty as well, using her make up box. Rin, hidden under the identity of Ageha, a legendary make up stylist, with a help from her classmate Kisaragi, who has to hide his real identity by crossdressing as a woman, is willing to do magic in front of the mirror and change girls "just like when a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly." How to meet Ageha and have her make you more beautiful? Easy, just write your name and class on the butterfly card and put it on the bulletin board on the 3rd floor. Ageha will come for sure, so what are you waiting for?\u000a\u000a(Source: JShoujo)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 1: Kagami no Kuni no Watashi (Myself in the mirror world; pilot)

Only minutes after he arrives does he accomplish his first goal; however, Joutarou finds that Jousuke is not only a much younger high school student, but he possesses a Stand of his own called Crazy Diamond.

VWhile the title suggests a story of simple, everyday school life, the contents are more the opposite. The setting is a strange school where you may see the principal wrestle a deer or a robot's arm hide a rollcake. However there are still normal stories, like making a card castle or taking a test you didn't study for. The art style is cute but mixes with extreme expressions and action sequences for surprising comedy bits.\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 2: Nichijou no Prototype (2 chapters)

VToua Tokuchi, a master of gambling and mind games, holds the remarkable record of 499 wins and zero losses in "One Outs," a simplified form of baseball that consists of only a batter and a pitcher. Visiting Okinawa, Tokuchi's hometown, is Hiromichi Kojima, the star batter of the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, the weakest team in the Japanese baseball league. Dreaming of leading the Lycaons to winning the championship, and in dire need of a replacement for their injured pitcher during a training camp, Kojima involves himself in a game of One Outs, only to lose to a normal fastball from the seemingly invincible Tokuchi.\u000a\u000aMesmerized by his prowess, Kojima recruits Tokuchi to the team after narrowly avoiding defeat in a rematch, believing he might just be their key to victory. However, the greedy owner of the Lycaons refuses to give him a decent salary, leading Tokuchi to suggest an unusual contract: every out he pitches will gain him five million yen, but every run he gives up will lose him fifty million yen. With his fate now tied to that of the team, Tokuchi's fight to bring the Lycaons to victory becomes yet another gamble\u2014the very thing that he does best.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VHaving a light novel author father and an eroge illustrator mother, Kanou Shinichi is a thoroughbred otaku. However he does not have any special power except for his broad knowledge, sharp insight, and impeccable instinct about "moe" and its products, from manga to anime to games to light novel to figures. One day he found himself transported to a fantasy world where elves live and dragons fly. And he is given a task\u2014not to fight monster or embark on a quest, but to enhance cultural exchange by becoming a "moe missionary" in this fantasy world! He meets a palace guard who has a bit of fujoshi taste, a half-elf maid, and the empress who is a little girl. He comes up with the idea of building a school. At first it runs as a comedy but later there are serious matters that Shinichi needs to face: ethnic discrimination, social problems, conflict with neighboring countries, sabotage by opposition elements including Japanese government and the likes. Can he overcome the obstacles, successfully bring "moe" culture to the fantasy world, and help the people there as well?

VWhen the two were still young, Saitou and Kawana Subaru were close friends. But with Subaru coming from a wealthy family, she was sent to the top school while Saitou had to settle for a regular education. But after painfully studying for years, he was finally accepted as a high school freshman through a scholarship program that only a handful of students are awarded. But what Saitou thought was going to be a heartwarming reunion turned out horrible. Subaru had grown up beautiful and was the most popular person in school as she was kind to everyone, all except towards Saitou who she seemed to despise.\u000a\u000aAlmost regretting his decision to come to the school, Saitou wishes that somehow their dorm rooms would connect to each other. Magically, because it turns out that Subaru wished the same thing, their wish comes true but, in return, Subaru loses her self-control for one hour per day. During that time, her erotic desire for Saitou, that she can normally hide, comes pouring out and her true intentions are revealed. He wants to take advantage of this once in a lifetime chance but doing so might jeopardize their relationship during the other 23 hours.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

Said cynical boy is Nonomiya who spends day in day out in boredom, taking refuge from his dull life in his imagination. One fateful day, he happens upon the notebook of the much-rumored beauty Youko Tsukimori, neglected on the ground. Poking out from it is a scrap of paper with the unexpected title "Murder Recipe." His interest ignited, he immediately stuffs it into his pocket, only to find out the promising recipe contains nothing but scenarios that may or may not lead to deadly accidents, not even worthy of being called a plan. When he tentatively asks her about it the next day, she hasn't lost anything. But then her father dies. An accident...\u000a\u000a(Source: Baka-Tsuki)

And how will Erika's relationship with Orpherus, Eduard, Naoji, Ludwig and Camus turn out, now that she was chosen as one of the Strahl secretaries?\u000a\u000a(Source: Kagami Scanlations)

VIn this story, Alice is not all what she seems. She is practical, strong, yet an cynical person. Instead of the traditional story, Alice is kidnapped unwillingly by a mysterious (yet somewhat bishie-looking) man with bunny ears into a place call Heartland. Stuck in Heartland due to a trick by the mysterious bunny eared man, she meets the residents of this world. Along the way, Alice meets Blood, handsome mafia leader; Ace, the psycho yet charming knight and more... What should Alice do in such a world!?\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

The war between humans (Terran) and vampires (Methuselah) continues, as a struggle between two factions: the Vatican and the New Human Empire.\u000a\u000aYet, amidst the bloodshed and violence, many desire a peaceful co-existence between the two species. However, standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other. To combat them, the Vatican special operations group "AX," led by Cardinal Caterina, must use everything they have\u2014even a vampire who preys on the blood of other vampires.\u000a\u000a(Source: Tokyopop)

VSatomi High's Football Club members are bunch of weirdos, there's a former yankee (delinquent), a former Hikikamori, one short-tempered guy and on top of that their captain is a 'chibi' (shorty), who looks more like primary schooler than a 2nd year high schooler, but don't be fooled - despite the fact of being all-freshman brand new team in a brand new high school, those guys made it to the best 4 of Chiba Prefecture last year! Their newest recruit is an almost 2m high guy, who is surprisingly bad at headings (despite having a height advantage). Fortunately the chibi-captain notices his potential as an attacking midfielder... How far can this team possibly go in this year's tournament?\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shots:\u000aVolume 1: Striker Yoshitsune\u000aVolume 2: Children of Symphony, Skull Jacker

Hinata was just a normal girl attending a Catholic school until she hears of the recent incidents in her area concerning a crime scene that looks like the doings of a vampire.

Or, is there more to him then what meets everyone's eye? The laws of vampires in his novels state that kisses are a contract\u2013a contract where the vampires are only allowed to drink the blood of the one they've kissed! And yet, this Tokinaga Junya claims he's never been kissed\u2026 could it be, he's a vampire?!

VAfter miraculously surviving a freak helicopter accident, Hikari "Picasso" Haruma finds that he somehow has the power to help people through his art. He is helped by his friend Chiaki Yamamoto who was killed in the helicopter accident, but came back as an angel. \u000a\u000aAccording to Chiaki, when the accident happened both she and Picasso died, but she begged God to save Picasso because of his wonderful talent, so Picasso survived the accident on condition that he saves other people. Basically when he sees someone in trouble, Picasso's able to draw a picture symbolizing the person's problem, and then enter that picture to see that person's hidden feelings and use that knowledge to help them in the real world.\u000a\u000a(Picasso got his nickname because he wrote his name \u30d2\u30ab\u30ea, hi-ka-ri, on his school shoes, but his \u30ea looked like a \u30bd (so) and Chiaki called him "Hikaso" so he ended up being called Picasso.

VReputation is everything in a world of icons and popularity contests. So why not score some points here and there by being the nice guy? This is the way Shinghi Kang legitimizes the fake personality he has everyone believing. Armed with his above average looks and a (completely false) angel-like personality, he has every girl in school head over heals, and all the guys looking to him for guidance. With the exception of having a screwed up cross-dressing devil for a dad, Shinghi's life is absolute perfection (*cough* of lies) until one day, Sung-Hae transfers to his school.\u000a\u000aWhile being a complete martial artist freak, she also likes to fib just a little in front of those who know her\u2026 you know, like acting like she's just a scared little girl who'd play with kittens rather than break brick walls with her head~! After all, how can anything go wrong when you're as cute as Sung-Hae?\u000a\u000aFate has brought these two masters of lies together and the two must battle it out to see who will be crowned the undefeated heavy-weight champion of fakeness!\u000a\u000a(Source: Infinity Studios)

VKuronuma Sawako is completely misunderstood by her classmates. Her timid and sweet demeanor is often mistaken for malicious behavior. This is due to her resemblance to the ghost girl from "The Ring," which has led her peers to give her the nickname Sadako. Longing to make friends and live a normal life, she is naturally drawn to Kazehaya Shouta, the most popular guy in class, whose "100% refreshing" personality earns him great admiration from Sawako. So when Kazehaya starts talking to her, maybe there is hope for the friendships Sawako has always longed for. Maybe...there is even a little hope for some romance in her future.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 22: Mayuge no Kakudo wa 45° de (45° Eyebrows)

During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association.

Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VOne would think that the ability to read minds would be incredible, but for Ayako Nakano, it is an involuntary power she wishes she never had. Being exposed to the harsh thoughts of others is one thing, but knowing what people want of her has made it difficult to act on her free will. Having quickly learned that revealing her power would alienate her from her peers, she keeps her abilities a secret, deciding that it is better to stay isolated and keep them hidden. Gloomy and friendless as a result of her power, Nakano is set to begin her final year of high school alone, as always.\u000a\u000aThis changes when she meets Hayato Toda. Though virtually expressionless, Toda is a popular student, and Nakano is puzzled to discover that he has an intense crush on her. Yet, his thoughts reveal something more: he has lewd, perverted fantasies of her nearly every minute of the day, which Nakano now has to suffer through on a daily basis. Even so, Nakano soon finds herself becoming a part of his group of friends, thrusting her into her very first foray into friendship and romance.\u000a\u000a[Written MAL Rewrite]

Three years ago, the world learned that harpies, centaurs, catgirls, and all manners of fabulous creatures are not merely fiction; they are flesh and blood\u2014not to mention scale, feather, horn, and fang. Thanks to the "Cultural Exchange Between Species Act," these once-mythical creatures have assimilated into society, or at least, they're trying.\u000a\u000aWhen a hapless human named Kurusu Kimihito is inducted as a "volunteer" into the government exchange program, his world is turned upside down. A snake-like lamia named Miia comes to live with him, and it is Kurusu's job to take care of her and make sure she integrates into his everyday life. Unfortunately for Kurusu, Miia is undeniably sexy, and the law against interspecies breeding is very strict. Even worse, when a ravishing centaur girl and a flirtatious harpy move in, what's a full-blooded young man with raging hormones to do?!\u000a\u000a(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)

VTeikou Middle School basketball club: an incredibly strong team with over one hundred members and three consecutive championship wins. Amongst their brilliant record, was a generation of five prodigies known as the "Generation of Miracles." However, there was a strange rumour concerning the Generation of Miracles about one more player recognized by the five prodigies... a Phantom Sixth Player.\u000a\u000aWhen Kagami Taiga joins Seirin High School's basketball team, he meets Kuroko Tetsuya, a horrendously bad player. Kagami is shocked to find out that Kuroko is the rumored sixth man of the Generation of Miracles. Not only is Kuroko terrible at everything from dribbling to shooting, he lacks so much presence on the court that at times people even forget he's playing. But during games Kuroko uses that lack of presence to his advantage, specializing in passing the ball to stronger players. In order to become the best player in Japan, Kagami agrees to team up with Kuroko to defeat the other members of the Generation of Miracles.\u000a\u000a(Source: Crunchyroll)

She wants nothing more than to live in the city, far away from the villagers and their outdated ways of thinking. So when a new European-style house is built on a hill in the village, Megumi believes its residents must be cultured and refined, so she decides to pay them a visit.\u000a\u000aHowever, Megumi doesn't return home that night. After a grueling search, she is found the next day, weak and anemic, with strange bite marks on her. But Megumi is just the first victim in what will soon become an epidemic in Sotoba as the bodies start piling up. The village doctor Toshio Ozaki, along with the priest Seishin Muroi, the loner Natsuno Yuuki, and the Tanaka siblings Kaori and Akira, begin investigating the strange deaths. But the answer to their predicament may be more than any of them can handle, for soon the dead could outnumber the living.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

The culprit who doomed Ewon to this life is none other than Jiho, Ewon's jealous ex who still burns at Ewon's infidelity. Their gang leader Mookyul, with movie-star good looks and the bizarre, drunken habit of biting people on the neck, takes a keen interest in his attractive new errand boy. Will Ewon be able to survive the violent underworld (not to mention the constant sexual harassment) he must endure as an underling of Mookyul?

VItou Kaiji is a bum who steals car emblems and slashes tires on what seems to be a regular basis. This routine changes one day when he is paid a visit by a man in a trench-coat. Once the two get talking, it seems that the visitor (Calling himself Endou) is a debt collector. The reason for his visit is an unpaid loan which kaiji had previously co-signed for a work-mate (Furuhata Takeshi). The original loan was 30000 yen and once Takeshi had disappeared, the loan then fell on Kaiji.\u000a\u000aKaiji is then told of a way to clear the interest compounded debt (which stood at 3,850,000 yen), which involved getting on a boat with others in his position. Once on the boat the debtors would then have to gamble with loaned money, which would end with a few winning, and others getting into deeper debt and having to work to pay of their debts. After some coercing kaiji accepts a position on the boat, in order to clear himself and make a bit of money as well...\u000a\u000a(Source: AniDB)

Unable to simply ignore it like the other guys in class, Yuuya can't stop thinking about Izumi and wonders if he's actually a girl, especially after Yuuya sees Izumi waving to a good-looking guy who he suspects is Izumi's boyfriend. Intent to find out more about who Izumi really is, Yuuya follows him after school, only to end up being dropkicked by him over a misunderstanding. Izumi later tells Yuuya that he started cross-dressing to put his twin sister Yurika at ease, who is extremely afraid of guys. However, Izumi confides in Yuuya that he has one other reason why he cross-dresses, something Izumi has never told anyone else.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VThe end of the civil war signaled the start of the industrial revolution in the United States and immigrants from all over the world traveled to find their American dream. But what awaited the majority of them was poverty, discrimination and hopelessness. Manhattan, New York was full of immigrants flooding through the ports and the 6th district, Five Points, was considered at the time, the world's worst slum. The mobsters corrupted the entire area, including the police by paying them off; Five Points was the mob's territory and they were the law.\u000a\u000aBut even in Five Points, where there seemed to be nothing but robbery, prostitution and murder, showed some signs of hope. Luke Burns was a honest and righteous teenager who realized that the mob was the cause of the harsh lifestyle and that joining the mobsters would not bring him the American dream. But his older brother, Brad Burns, had become the assassin to the biggest mob group of Five Points, the Grave Diggers, a secret he kept from Luke for his own protection. Brad was known as the Grim Reaper and his reputation preceded him as a ruthless and skilled killer.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VLife is never ordinary. What begins with a college dropout bored of her mediocre routine soon becomes a fantastic series of vignettes about the unexpected ways that lives intersect. Filled with magical realism in the face of the cold reality of modern life, at their core these stories are about discovering something precious in the chaos of existence. A dream recaptured. A life on a new track. The absurdity of death. Laughter in the face of reality. With this series of intersecting vignettes, Inio Asano explores the ways in which modern life can be ridiculous and sublime, terrible and precious, wasted and celebrated.\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Media)

VYuiko Kubozuka is a high school girl who loves animals. Unfortunately, animals hate her and flee from her whenever possible. So when a new classmate, Leo Aoi, turns out to be a scary guy who resembles a wild animal than anything human, she is intrigued.

He seems to hide a very sweet disposition behind his scary features.\u000a\u000aOr so she thought. The truth is revealed when they are attacked and Leo immediately behaves like a wild animal and gets violent like a blood-thirsty animal, just to save Yuiko.\u000a\u000aWill Yuiko be able to tame this wildest of all animals or will he be just like the others and flee from her? Or the better question, will she flee from him?\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shots:\u000aVolume 1: Fly\u000aVolume 2: Saboten Summer Surprise (Cactus Summer Surprise)

VThere once lived a vampire known as Vanitas, hated by his own kind for being born under a blue full moon, as most arise on the night of a crimson one. Afraid and alone, he created the "Book of Vanitas," a cursed grimoire that would one day take his vengeance on all vampires; this is how the story goes at least.\u000a\u000aVanitas no Carte follows Noé, a young man travelling aboard an airship in 19th century Paris with one goal in mind: to find the Book of Vanitas. A sudden vampire attack leads him to meet the enigmatic Vanitas, a doctor who specializes in vampires and, much to Noé's surprise, a completely ordinary human. The mysterious doctor has inherited both the name and the infamous text from the Vanitas of legend, using the grimoire to heal his patients. But behind his kind demeanor lies something a bit more sinister...\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

Now a sixteen-year-old girl, Umi dreams of finding love and having a boyfriend like many other girls her age. There's one guy at school whom she's really interested in, but things don't really go the way she wants them to, with another guy showing up out of nowhere... Not to mention, that guy isn't just your average guy.\u000a\u000a(Source: Aerandria Scans)

VCane Lele was born into the fashion industry. Her mother, Ye Feii, was Taiwan's top model, and her father was also a model, until a tragic airplane crash left Lele without parents.\u000a\u000aTherefore it is no surprise that Lele hates the industry, thinking it superficial and unnecessary. Raised by her paternal grandmother, Lele reaches seventeen before she is sucked in by her mother's sister, Ye Feihung, a fashion agent (and former model) who "convinces" the reluctant Lele to pose. Lele is adverse to the whole idea, until she sees a photo shoot of popular American model Angus Lanson, and she begins to see modeling as an art form.\u000a\u000aWhen Aunt Feihung's magazine editor invites Angus Lanson to a meeting of all the top fashion ambassadors, Lele is invited along and is curious to meet Angus. She does not know that Angus' twin elder brother, Eros Lanson, is secretly accompanying his brother. This obviously leads to confusion and is the start of a charming story of Lele's goals: Fashion in New York city, becoming a top model, and love? \u000a\u000a(Source: ShoujoMagic)

The father of the girls is unwilling to accept the deformed twin into his family and so he places her in a sack and disposes of her at a rubbish dump.

After seven years, she leaves the dump and heads for the distant lights of the city\u2014there she will discover that human blood tastes best of all and maybe find out something about the family that abandoned her.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

VLong ago, there was a god of light and a god of darkness. While those devoted to the god of light experienced happiness and good fortune, the god of darkness would play tricks on the people and steal their joy. And so, as the legend goes, the god of light decided to punish him by turning him into a monster. Enraged by this, the god of darkness wielded his punishment as a curse in order to inflict suffering upon others. Because of his actions, he was banished to the Outside, where he and his monstrous children are to remain for eternity, while those from the Inside must never come in contact with someone from the Outside, lest they be cursed with a hideous form.\u000a\u000aA little girl named Shiva, an Insider, is found by an Outsider she comes to know as Sensei. Though they cannot touch, Sensei cares for Shiva as best he can, and together they live a moderately happy life. But soon, Shiva not only finds herself in danger from the Outside, but from her own kind as well.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VUnrequited love is a tragic circumstance with no simple resolution. It comes in many forms, yet each one shares the same debilitating feeling of inconceivable longing.\u000a\u000aHanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya are two high school students who appear to have the ideal relationship. They are the envy of their classmates, and it is easy to portray them as the classic example of high school sweethearts. Unbeknownst to friends and family, however, there is a side to their love veiled by hidden passions: their true affections lie elsewhere, and they use each other to physically sate their unreciprocated feelings.\u000a\u000aHanabi is in love with Narumi Kanai, her new homeroom teacher who is also her childhood friend. Mugi is in love with Akane Minagawa, who used to be his tutor when he was younger. Now teachers at the same school, Kanai and Minagawa begin to show an interest in one another. As a result, Mugi and Hanabi find solace in each other as victims of the same pain.\u000a\u000aWith little hope of their feelings being realized, these two students face a challenging predicament: cope with and move on from their lust, or become further entangled in their web of unrequited love.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shots:\u000aVolume 1: Nyan Nyan Prelude\u000aVolume 2: Nyan Nyan Serenade\u000aVolume 3: Nyan Nyan Oratorio\u000aVolume 4: Nyan Nyan Cantata\u000aVolume 5: Nyan Nyan Andante

VAfter a powerful earthquake nearly destroyed all of Tokyo, a prison known as Deadman Wonderland rose from what was left of the city. Privately-run through the guise and functions of a theme park, Deadman Wonderland takes in prisoners from all over Japan, using them as attractions for tourists. Little do the public know about the true purpose of this "theme park" and the horrors that take place within.\u000a\u000aEnter Ganta Igarashi, a middle school student who has lived a normal life since the great earthquake occurred. This all changes when a mysterious masked murderer called the Red Man appears and kills his entire class, knocking him unconscious which consequently left him as the sole survivor. When he awakens, he is falsely convicted as the perpetrator behind the massacre, landing him a spot in Deadman Wonderland. What will become of this new inmate whose life depends on the bizarre "games" that this prison holds? And just what does Shiro, Ganta's supposed childhood friend who awaits his arrival, know about the Red Man?\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VDuring a school cruise trip, a group of friends are thrown back to the year 1636. According to history, in 1637 a revolt known as the Shimabara Revolt broke. It was a rebellion by Christian rebels and led by a charismatic youth known as Amakusa Shirou, which ended in the defeat of the rebels and resulted in the loss of 3,000 lives. Hayumi Natsuki, our heroine, is mistaken as Amakusa Shirou by the villagers she met, never mind that the real Amakusa Shirou is male. Apparently the real Amakusa Shirou died the year previously, before gaining recognition or popularity as a leader among the people. Before long, she became famous as some-sort of heaven-sent angel and people started calling her "Shirou," believing she is the savior prophesied 25 years before.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN)

VTada Banri, a newly admitted student at a private law school in Tokyo, found himself completely lost after the opening ceremony, trying to find his way to the freshman orientation. At that moment, he ran into another lost freshman from the same school, Yanagisawa Mitsuo, and they hit it off at once. Somehow arriving at their intended goal just on time, there appeared in front of the two a beautiful girl holding a bouquet of roses. The girl then whacked Mitsuo across the face with the bouquet and handed the flowers over to him. "Freshman, congratulations," was all she said, and then she left. The stylish, well dressed, perfect woman that had swung at Mitsuo was his childhood friend, Kaga Kouko. As children they had promised to marry each other one day, fulfilling their dreams. In order to escape from her, Mitsuo had gone out secretly and taken the examination for this well known private college, but now she showed up in the freshman orientation hall. She too had taken the law school entrance examination, catching up with him there.\u000a\u000a(Source: Baka-Tsuki)

We start off with him coming to visit his twin (?) brother Ken.

However, his childhood friend, Sumire, doesn't think that he is capable of becoming one. In his photography club, Oji shows his photos to the group, and his upperclassman, Ran, points out that Sumire is a good target to photograph. Oji manages to get permission to take photos of Sumire, and during his shoot, Sumire notices that Oji is acting differently than before. Later they find out that one of Oji's pictures won an award!

VAmong the seaside town of Izu's ocean waves and rays of shining sun, Iori Kitahara is just beginning his freshman year at Izu University. As he moves into his uncle's scuba diving shop, Grand Blue, he eagerly anticipates his dream college life, filled with beautiful girls and good friends.\u000a\u000aBut things don't exactly go according to plan. Upon entering the shop, he encounters a group of rowdy, naked upperclassmen, who immediately coerce him into participating in their alcoholic activities. Though unwilling at first, Iori quickly gives in and becomes the heart and soul of the party. Unfortunately, this earns him the scorn of his cousin, Chisa Kotegawa, who walks in at precisely the wrong time. Undeterred, Iori still vows to realize his ideal college life, but will things go according to plan this time, or will his situation take yet another dive?\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VStories of old tell of four otherworldly heroes\u2014wielding the sword, spear, bow, and shield\u2014who defended the land from wave after wave of calamity. With the fate of the world in balance, the kingdom of Melromarc summons these legendary figures; in modern-day Japan, the call is answered, and the unwitting heroes are transported to this fantasy universe.\u000a\u000aThrust into Melromarc and given the title of "Shield Hero," otaku Naofumi Iwatani is labeled the weakest due to his lack of offensive capability and apparent inexperience. When the heroes part ways to start their journeys, he only has one willing companion: the beautiful princess Malty Melromarc. However, she soon betrays him, steals all his money, and accuses him of taking advantage of her.\u000a\u000aFor his alleged crimes, Naofumi is branded a criminal and made outcast of society. With hatred filling his heart, he sets out alone, vowing vengeance against those who wronged him.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VIn a not too distant future, the world is confronted with a host of issues: pollution, resource depletion, population expansion, and so on. In response, the Japanese government developed sensory simulation capsules (\u201cbeds\u201d) and successfully launched a virtual reality program \u2014 \u201cGaia.\u201d Interestingly, the designers omitted the concept of pain from the program, and as a result, there are no such things as pain or death in this new virtual world.\u000a\u000aOn a day that started as any other, Oono Yuuri stumbles across a mysterious card, which sets off a chain of strange events that evolve into a tale of conflicting dreams, unlikely friendships, and reluctant vengeance.\u000a\u000a(Source: Mixini Studios)

VTokyo Police Department's Cybercrime Division is headed by the young, brilliantly ruthless Yoshino Erika. Her track record has been solid, but when a new threat appears online, it starts making all the headlines. A man who goes by Shinbunshi, because of the newspaper mask he wears, begins acting as a vigilante of justice. His message is simple: he can see what is wrong with society right now and although he doesn't have the power to change it, he can help the frustrated citizens release their pent up anger from the crimes that go unpunished like people treating others like trash, corrupt government pushing their weight around and other issues the typical person has no control over. Although it starts relatively harmless, it quickly snowballs out of control thanks to the power of social media and the Shinbunshi becomes an overnight internet sensation with the severity of the crimes exponentially increasing.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

The fact that the Prince of her class, Inogami Yuuki, is the only person who's nice to her, makes another reason for them to pick on her. One day new transfer student Yashiro Akira accuses Arisa of bullying him when she lived in his hometown, but the thing is Arisa has no memory of her life before she fell down the stairs five years ago! Could the timid Arisa really be the tyrant ARISA of the past? Is there such a thing as split personality? What other "memories" will come to trouble her.

For despite his inwardly sweet personality, his unintentionally sharp gaze and aggressive features give him the air of a delinquent thug, putting his chances at making new friends, let alone a girlfriend, next to zero.\u000a\u000aIt's Ryuuji's first day of his second year of high school and it seems as if things are looking up. He gets to sit in between his only friend, Yuusaku, and more importantly, the girl he's secretly crushing on, Kushieda Minori. But just when he thinks the stars are aligned in his favor, he unwittingly crosses the most feared girl in school, Aisaka Taiga, making her into his arch enemy. To top it off, Taiga has moved in right next door to Ryuuji and happens to be Minori's best friend! Can this school year possibly get any worse?!\u000a\u000a(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)

Despite this, he dreams of becoming the Wizard King, a title bestowed upon the strongest mage in the Clover Kingdom. Possessing the same aspiration, Asta's childhood friend and rival Yuno has been blessed with the ability to control powerful wind magic. Even with this overwhelming gap between them, hoping to somehow awaken his magical abilities and catch up to Yuno, Asta trains his body relentlessly every day.\u000a\u000aIn the Clover Kingdom, once a person turns 15 years old, it is time for them to receive their Grimoire, an item allowing its wielder to use their magic to its full capacity. At the ceremony, Yuno obtains a Grimoire with a legendary four-leaf clover, indicating the exceptional strength of its wielder, while Asta pointlessly waits for his. Feeling dejected, yet unwilling to give up, Asta sees Yuno caught by a mage who is trying to steal Yuno's special Grimoire. Despite being completely overpowered by Yuno's captor, Asta's will to keep fighting rewards him with his very own Grimoire\u2014one with an unheard-of black five-leaf clover.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VEvery day in Japan, 2500 people die due to any number of causes. Do you think you'll be one of the ones to die? No, of course not. Do you think you'll win the lottery? You'd like to think so, we all would. But Sumida is different. He wants the status quo to remain in every way; live a normal life, get a normal job, have normal kids, never to be anyone fortunate or unfortunate, content in normalcy. Anyone who doesn't agree is foolish, doomed to live their life scraping up a mountain that they can never conquer, fated to die in despair wishing things had been better.\u000a\u000aWhen his mother kicks his father out of the house and onto the streets, he thinks he'll be fine. When his mother leaves him to live with her boyfriend, he makes the best of it. When he realizes that he's no longer average, he strives to make his life worthwhile the only way he knows how. When the demons in the back of his mind speak to him, he tries his best to ignore them.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VJonah is a child soldier, born amidst the chaotic conflicts that rage across West Asia, his family lost to a war fueled by weapons supplied by the so-called Merchants of Death\u2014international arms dealers. Despite Jonah's hatred of weapons and violence, he employs both extremely well in the service of high-flying arms dealer Koko Hekmatyar and her band of mercenaries. Their journey through the dark underbelly of the world's arms markets may lead only to damnation, but will Jonah one day make his way back to the light? Only one thing is certain: it's going to be a long, hard road out of hell...\u000a\u000aKoko Hekmatyar, the head of H&C Logistic Incorporated, introduces new recruit Jonah to her team of troubleshooters, and it isn't long before they have some trouble to shoot. An Eastern European government official is holding up a shipment of aircraft parts that would shift the balance of power in the region. The trouble is, that shipment belongs to Koko, and she's not about to miss an opportunity to make a profit, even if it means two nations go to war.\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Media)

VYear 2130 -- after the third world war, large contaminated areas known as "Blackspots" formed all over Japan. Large Walls were used to quarantine off these "Blackspots". In time, signs of inhabitance appeared within these wastelands. Among the survivors who had been abandoned inside the Blackspots, labeled as "those who were unneeded", came forth possessors of uncanny abilities -- Fire, wind, brute strength...they were defined by their supernatural abilities. Others, fearful of their powers, expelled them and named them --- Needless!\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VPunpun Onodera is a normal 11-year-old boy living in Japan. Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle\u2014though nonetheless startling\u2014turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a naïve boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.\u000a\u000aAs his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VOne day in the 21st century, a gate opened in the middle of the Ginza district of Tokyo. Out of the gate poured soldiers and strange creatures, and they soon made Ginza look like an image of hell. The gate apparently connected Japan to another world, a world with a militant empire and many supernatural creatures. The Japanese Self-Defense Force decided to send a small group, led by a soldier who's also an otaku, into the other world on a reconnaissance mission. They're meant to learn what they can about the empire (and its plans), the world, and the people.\u000a\u000aThey're hardly in the world yet, though, when they come across a village destroyed by a giant fire-breathing dragon. The only survivor is an unconscious elven girl they find hidden in a well. Now they feel like they must warn the nearby towns about the dragon, and do what they can to help. On the way, they'll meet more magical, female companions, and learn more about this dangerous new world.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VA 34-year-old NEET gets killed in a traffic accident and finds himself in a world of magic. Rather than waking up as a full-grown mage, he gets reincarnated as a newborn baby, retaining the memories of his past life. Before he can even properly move his body, he resolves to never make the same mistakes he made in his first life ever again and instead live a life with no regrets with the new one that was given to him. Because he has the knowledge of a middle-aged man, by the age of two, he has already become a prodigy and possesses power unthinkable for anyone his age and even older. Thus begins the chronicles of Rudeus Greyrat, son of swordsman Paul and healer Zenith, as he enters a new world to become the strongest mage known to man, with powers rivaling even the gods themselves.

After his father's death, a former-boxer Yakuza man taught him how to do a basic punch, and that punch saved his life when he had to defend himself from his mom's drug dealer. He ended up taking the drug dealer's life, marking him as a killer. Criminals continued to come after him, leading to more tragedy for the people who attempted to care for him.

VWith the space program attempting to travel to Mars, 21st century scientists were tasked with warming up the planet so that humans could survive on its surface. They came up with an efficient and cost effective plan of sending cockroaches and mold to the surface so that the mold would absorb the sunlight and the insect corpses would serve as a food source for the mold.\u000a\u000aIt is now the year 2577 and the first manned ship to Mars has landed on the planet and the six crew members are ready for their mission. But what they find are giant mutated humanoid cockroaches with incredible physical strength. The crew members are easily wiped out, but not before sending a transmission back to Earth. Now, humanity will send elite warriors to exterminate the mutated bugs and claim back Mars.\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VFebruary 23rd, 20XX.\u000a\u000aLooking for a job in the famous TV station at Odaiba, college senior Jin Mishima attended the recruitment orientation. Not far away from the station, Nanako Okano, a gothic lolita trying to attend a concert, found out that her friends tricked her about the concert ticket because of jealousy. The two bumped into each other and "reunited", they were junior high classmates, moments before an earthquake of Richter Scale 8.1 turned the island (the entire city, in fact) into ruins. \u000a\u000aFrom here on, 51 Ways is a predictable but remarkably believable survival adventure. Based on a well-researched novel by Minoru Watanabe, the series paints a picture not quite as explicit and horrifying as ones in other apocalyptic fiction, but one that is frightening in it's detail. \u000a\u000aLike many of Furuya's other works, we're also shown just how fragmented and superficial Japanese youth has become: gals, rock stars, Gothic Lolita's, otaku, salarymen, ganguro, and schoolgirls are all here in their self-imposed stereotypical, shallow glory. But while the ugliness of the fragmentation of Tokyo youth is striking - these people all come together in the face of disaster in a way that's ultimately hopeful. When you strip off the posing and expensive clothing: we're all the same.\u000a\u000aIn the end, 51 Ways is one of Furuya's most optimistic and mainstream works. It would make a lovely gateway drug for more timid independant comic readers or shoujo fans looking for something with a bit more bite.\u000a\u000a(Source: ANN & Anime Online)

Telekinesis, teleportation, and astral projection might sound exciting to the average person, but from Saiki's viewpoint, they are nothing but an annoyance. Psychic powers are unnecessary\u2014this is all that Saiki has believed since he was a kid.\u000a\u000aAs a secret esper with the sole dream of living an ordinary life, Saiki tries to use his psychic abilities to stay out of the public's gaze. However, having to clean up after his odd classmates and their antics, all the while keeping his psychic powers a secret, makes it rather difficult to achieve the peaceful life he desires.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VTatsuhiko Kido, a vocational/technical school student who's staying in his school's dorms, one day discovers a hole in the wall of his apartment room. He peeks through the hole, but when he does so, he sees his neighbor, Ikuno Emiru, masturbating and he's caught peeking! However, when he goes over to inform her of the hole in the wall, she shuts the door in his face. Luckily for him, he's able to stop the door from closing and pursues after her, but, in his haste, he trips and lands right on top of her. As luck would have it, she takes a picture of them in a compromising position and tries to blackmail him into getting naked?!\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VIn a seaside town where very little happens, middle school students Keisuke Isobe and Koume Satou live a rather dull life. But when Koume's crush breaks her heart, their situation becomes quite unordinary. She starts a "no-strings-attached" relationship with Keisuke, whom she had previously rejected, both finding solace in the other in order to fill the emotional voids in their lives. However, being "friends with benefits" becomes complicated when real feelings begin to develop, as the consequences of their relationship start to take their toll on those around them and themselves.\u000a\u000aUmibe no Onnanoko takes a harsh look at love, relationships, and the emotional price that will be paid as the result of a decision made between two teenagers.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VAt a very young age, Kousei Arima was strictly taught how to play the piano and meticulously follow the score by his mother, to the point where he dominated every competition he entered with ease. He earned the title of "Human Metronome" for performing almost perfectly. Every musician of his age looked up to him. However, after his mother suddenly dies, he became tone-deaf due to the shock and then disappeared, never to be seen onstage since.\u000a\u000aTwo years later, Kousei lives a monotonous life with his childhood friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari supporting him. He continues to cling to music, although performing is still an impossibility for him. This is until his unexpected encounter with Kaori Miyazono, a violinist who performs freely without the dictations of a score. A story of friendship, love, music, and a single lie, Kousei's life begins to change and gain color as Kaori helps him to take up music again.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

The Vatican has refused to acknowledge the situation, treating each incident as nothing more than simple coincidence, but in the years that have passed since the Holy War ended, the Pope has been rumored to have created an occult organization called RADEM, whose orders are to fight demons though they seem to have another mission - a much more obscure mission...\u000a\u000aThe Cardinal calls for an assembly of the region\u2019s clergymen in the name of the Pope to discuss the situation, and to that end, an ambitious nun named Sister Rose is sent to the Teatela Province on a mission to locate Father Gabriel Iota - a priest suspected of possessing a very strong Holy Power...\u000a\u000a(Source: Cireus-Scanlations)

However, someone else takes the fall for the crime, and Mashiro gleefully informs him that their film was a "winner" on Dead Tube.\u000a\u000aAs more and more of the school starts to get involved with Dead Tube, many quickly get in over their heads from the punishments for failing the contests. And, since he helped with Mashiro's video, Machiya must participate, and continue filming for this deadly game.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

Rinka might have thought it was a hallucination if there hadn't been another witness with her, a boy from her school with a strangely scratched-up face.\u000a\u000aContact with a fish caused her to pass out, and when she awoke, she had developed the power to move through inanimate objects... such as the floor of her apartment! Later, a call from her father showed her that she was not the only one the flying fish bestowed with hard-to-control superpowers! What exactly is going on here? And does Rinka's classmate know more about this situation than he's letting on?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VHasegawa Kodaka has transferred schools, and he's having a hard time making friends. It doesn't help that his blond hair tends to make people think he's a delinquent. One day, he runs into his bad-tempered solitary classmate Yozora while she's talking animatedly to her imaginary friend Tomo. Realizing that neither of them have any actual friends, they decide that the best way to alter this situation is to form a club and start recruiting.\u000a\u000aThat is how "Rinjin-bu" was formed, a club specifically designed for people who don't have very many friends. As other lonely classmates slowly join their little club, they'll try to learn how to build friendships through cooking together, playing games, and other group activities. But will this group of relationship-challenged misfits really be able to get along?\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

Her ex tells her that she must apply to a "housework" club before he reconsiders going out with her. Therefore Reo-chan has little choice but to join. But here's the catch: the only members are four gorgeous bishies. The other first year in the club, Irinaka, competes with her a lot. As the story progresses Reo and Irinaka get forced into a lot of interesting situations together and in the meantime become closer and closer.

Now, even though she lives alone and without relatives, Teru never feels lonely because Daisy is her constant confidant and supporter.\u000a\u000aIn order to pay off a debt, Teru finds herself needing to work for the rude, inconsiderate, and abusive (not to mention quite handsome) school janitor, Kurosaki Tasuku. While her predicament seems on the opposite spectrum of her relationship with Daisy, maybe Teru's two different worlds are more closely connected than she thought?\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 16: Hetakuso Cupid (The Hopeless Cupid)

Instead, an ominous alien mothership looms overhead, engulfing the city skyscape.\u000a\u000aThree years ago, they came. The arrival of the "Invaders" sparked the greatest war humanity had ever faced\u2014one that threatened to end the world. The Japanese government scrambled to fight the Invaders. Weapons were mass-produced, sparking controversy and pacifist movements.\u000a\u000aThat day, everything changed. And yet, nothing has changed. Koyama Kadode and Nakagawa Ouran live their final days like they always have: going to school, playing with friends, and doing what any carefree high school girls would do.\u000a\u000aAs they grow up they come to learn what it truly means to be an adult, in a world where adults seem to be demons who only deceive and destroy. They come to learn the real threat to humanity is not the Invaders, but humanity itself.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VUnknown to her classmates, Yukina Himuro is secretly the popular cell phone novelist Yupina. What they do know, however, is her cold demeanor and icy glare\u2014earning her the nickname "Absolute Zero Snow Woman"\u2014so they tend to avoid her.\u000a\u000aBut as of late, Yukina has run into a bit of a snag with her writing: her ratings have gone down, so she wants to incorporate romance to bring them back up. And since Yukina has no experience with love, she cannot properly convey it in her writing. While seeking to change this, she runs into popular and charming student council president Shigure Kitami. During said encounter, he drops his notebook, and, to Yukina's surprise, she finds the names of the girls who have confessed to Shigure inside. She discovers that he uses his charm to manipulate girls into confessing their love for him just so he can reject them, and that his real personality is nothing like the one he shows to the world. Confronting Shigure with this information, she develops a plan: to blackmail him into teaching her about love. But when Yukina's cousin and only friend, Akira Shimotsuki, becomes jealous and confesses his love to her, Yukina may find herself with more help for these "missions of love" than she asked for.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VRabbit Doubt has taken Tokyo by storm. In this cellphone survival game, players grouped together are "rabbits" tasked with hunting down the "wolf" hidden amongst them. Unless the rabbits can identify their enigmatic predator, the wolf will eliminate one of them every turn until the whole colony has been wiped out.\u000a\u000aPlayers of the game often convene in real life, which is exactly what Yuu Aikawa does when he meets Rei Hazama, Haruka Akechi, and Eiji Hoshi. Together with Yuu's longtime friend, Mitsuki Houyama, the group decides to spend their time in a lively karaoke bar. During their revelry, Yuu leaves to check on one of his inebriated friends, but is suddenly knocked out by an unknown figure wearing a misshapen rabbit mask. After regaining consciousness, he finds himself in an abandoned psychiatric hospital, sharing a cell with a mysterious boy. Though the two soon manage to locate the others, their reunion is interrupted by a spine-chilling message in a cellphone: "Rabbit Doubt, Start!"\u000a\u000aIn Doubt, six high schoolers are thrust into a life-or-death survival game that will test their integrity and trust. With their lives at stake, they must quickly uncover the identity of the wolf that infiltrated their group\u2014or be hunted down like prey.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VThere is a Japanese saying that goes, "Hana yori dango," or "dumplings over flowers." And no one is more of an advocate of this adage than mangaka Y-naga, a woman whose life revolves around her intense work and equally intense sleep schedule. The only thing that can rouse her out of this infernal cycle of deadlines and being dead to the world? Food. As Y-naga and her friends visit restaurants around Tokyo to satisfy their appetites, their individual approaches to food add an extra dimension to their witty and comical interactions. Friendships are explored and lifestyle choices revealed, all over exquisite culinary creations that prove that variety on an empty and open-minded stomach is, indeed, the spice of life.\u000a\u000a(Source: Yen Press)

However, before he starts his show, he always asks his audience: "Do you believe in magic?"\u000a\u000aFor Yoon Ah-ee, magic seems like a distant memory. Faced with the harsh reality of poverty, she spends all her time studying, working, and taking care of her younger sister in the absence of their parents.

VHis late father always said that a useless man should strive to be useful, so to that end, third-year high school student Nariyuki Yuiga dedicated himself to becoming a high-achieving student in his school, despite his history of poor grades. In order to give his destitute family a better life, his ultimate goal is to obtain the special VIP nomination, a prestigious scholarship covering all future university tuition fees. Although Nariyuki could feasibly be a shoe-in for the nomination, he is constantly overshadowed by classmates Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in mathematics and literature, respectively.\u000a\u000aTo his delight, Nariyuki receives the nomination, but there's a catch: he has to tutor his two star classmates, who are each hopelessly mediocre at the other\u2019s subject of expertise! To make matters worse, the subjects they are horrible at are the same subjects they want to pursue for their future. As the time to submit university applications draws nearer, Nariyuki must find an effective tutoring method for the girls before it\u2019s too late. \u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VA legend says that the ghost of a girl stands on the top of an old Catholic church, inhabited by the Sagimiya family. Said family has a hateful rivalry with the Bijogi family, who manage a Taoist temple next door. In the middle of all this, Bijogi Taiga has had a crush on Sagimiya Anna, the demure daughter of the priest, since childhood.\u000a\u000aLittle did he know, the Sagimiya are involved in very un-Catholic activities such as trying to resurrect the spirit of Marie-Thérèse Charlotte, the daughter of the late French queen Marie Antoinette and who has a seemingly endless appetite for food. And since he has found out, he will have to "collaborate"\u2014i.e. be the human sacrifice to that end. Nevertheless, just before the "ritual," Taiga decides to confess his love to Anna and is struck by a lightning bolt the second after. He miraculously survives without a scratch, but somehow finds himself in a body slightly more... blonde and feminine.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 4: Tiger-ani to Dragon (Tiger Dragon Brothers)

In reality, the young boy has one-fourth of youkai blood and is the heir to a large clan of youkai led by his grandfather, Nurarihiyon. As a small child, he was told that youkai often perform evil deeds, leading to his reluctance to succeed the Nura Clan and doing whatever he could to avoid his destiny.\u000a\u000aDuring the night, Rikuo undergoes a transformation into a fearsome youkai who resembles Nurarihiyon in his prime. Realizing that he can use his power to protect others, he accepts his inheritance, aiming to unite all the youkai factions across Japan and establish his own "Night Parade of a Hundred Demons."\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VThe story centers around Akihisa Yoshii, the "baka" of the title. His academy rigidly divides up the student body into classes based on the results of tests. The prodigies are in the A class with reclining seats complete with air conditioning, but Akihisa is in F class, the lowest rung of the school ladder which is furnished only with low, decrepit tables and worn-out straw tatami mats. A girl named Mizuki Himeji is actually one of the smartest girls in Akihisa's sophomore year, but she had a fever on test day and was pigeonholed into the F class. Besides Mizuki (who Akihisa secretly adores), the F class also has Yuuji Sakamoto, the class president who has been Akihisa's friend and partner-in-crime since the freshman year.\u000a\u000aThe school happens to have developed experiments to summon fantasy creatures, and Akihisa decides to rally F class to take on the higher-tiered classes and seize their perks. The F class uses the summoned creatures in an all-out battle for school supremacy.

VAs a child, Masamune Makabe once suffered greatly at the hands of a wealthy and beautiful girl named Aki Adagaki, who nicknamed him "Piggy" due to his chubby appearance. Seeking revenge against his tormentor, Masamune works hard to improve himself and returns as an incredibly handsome, albeit narcissistic, high school student. When he encounters Aki once again, he is prepared to exact vengeance.\u000a\u000aWith the aid of the rich girl's maid, Yoshino Koiwai, Masamune slowly begins to build his relationship with Aki, intending to break her heart when the time is right. However, as his friendship with Aki begins to grow, Masamune starts to question the objectives of his devious plans, and if bringing them to fruition is what his heart truly desires.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VKurokami Medaka, a first year, is elected as Student Council President, and the first thing she does is establish a suggestion box, later dubbed by students the "Medaka Box." Medaka encourages students to submit any problem to the box without hesitation and promises to take on any issue from anyone.\u000a\u000aSince Medaka won the Student Council elections with a staggering 98% of the vote, she ends up as the Council's only member. She asks her childhood friend, Hitoyoshi Zenkichi, for help and he grudgingly agrees, becoming the Student Council's lowest ranking member. Soon Medaka recruits two more people to the Student Council, the former judo club member Akune Kouki as secretary and the current swim club member Kikaijima Mogana, on loan for 300 yen a day, as treasurer.\u000a\u000aNow the Student Council members spend their days solving the problems submitted through the Medaka Box, whether they be hooligans in clubs where they don't belong, girls who need help writing love letters or people who've lost their pets, gradually earning the respect and admiration of the entire school.

While he is away from home, his artificial daughter Fran takes over the mansion and his grisly surgical practice. With the aid of her violent younger sister Veronica, the human-cat hybrid Okita, and Dr. Madaraki's other macabre creations, Fran deals with the unusual requests of her clients. From tumor removal to reviving the dead, no two jobs are alike, but no job is too difficult\u2014or too dangerous\u2014for the successor to Dr. Madaraki. This eccentric medical prodigy is willing to do anything to save a life, even if her results are seldom pretty.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 7: Phase 20

Four survivors, who may well be the last of the human race, have found one another and are sharing a quiet, peaceful existence. These survivors are a kind, dependable teenage boy called Masashi, two teenage girls, shyer Sanae and bolder Yaeko, and a little girl called Anna. They feel as though they're just living in a perpetual "after school" state, waiting for the rest of the human race to come home. As they pass their days together, they begin to see some strange things and find that the monsters have not yet left the Earth. Will they discover what really happened to their planet?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

But one day, after he catches yet another group of criminals, Keyman is mysteriously murdered.

Their case gets even stranger when Alex unexpectedly meets "Dr. Necro," who appears to be a young girl, in a bar.

V"Here be monsters," this expression has always been used to speak of the ocean\u2014a dark, impenetrable world that can only conceal unimaginable horrors that the human can't see... often not until it is too late. A series of unexplained accidents happen at a submarine platform 6,000 meters beneath the surface and, in response, a group of scientists and cadres are sent to investigate. Before long, the members of the party start to get haunted by horrifying, elusive visions... and the rash of brutal deaths once again resumes. Is it just a collection of freak accidents and hallucinations caused by sheer paranoia, the claustrophobic environment and dysbarism... or is there really something more lurking in this abyssal station?\u000a\u000a(Source: jCafe24)

VMichiru is a high school boy who isn't really good at anything, including sports and socializing. He likes watching one of his classmates, Haruka, as she practices swimming. Haruka happens to be the only member of the swimming club associated with his school.

VLeticia's father, the current king, is very wise and knew that both of his sons have their own supporters and that if either one became king the other brother's supporters would rebel, and the country would have a civil war. So he decided to announce that he will retire while he's still alive and make his daughter, the princess, his successor! However, the princess never expected to be Queen and she really doesn't have any political allies. So she decides to gather a group of knights loyal to her and form her own "round table" before the day of her coronation. The problem is, all of the good knights who are strong and skillful and loyal have already been snatched up by her father and brothers for their own personal guards.\u000a\u000a(Source: AQUA Scans)

After an incident brought on by his frustration and jealousy, he was crushed to overhear those same 'friends' discussing how they wished he'd just kill himself.\u000a\u000aOn his way to toss out his special basketball shoes, he met a girl who was just as frustrated, throwing her own dancing shoes away. She was so tall, and her hands and feet are so large, that she had been rejected from her chosen hobby of Spanish dancing. He urged her to give basketball a try, and the two exchanged their shoes instead of throwing them away.\u000a\u000aAs he enters high school, Kimitaka learns that meeting him changed that girl's life for the better, and she is now a happy, social basketball player. Will Kimitaka be able to find the courage to make new friends and pursue his own talents?\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

This has caused a lot of trouble in his life, but now he has learned to fight back against the evil spirits! Unfortunately, he's now also very poor, homeless, and hoping for a happier, more normal, high school life. In his search for housing, he's introduced to a very cheap boarding house called Yuragi Manor, which was formerly a popular hot springs inn. It's so cheap because the house is haunted by the spirit of a high school student whose corpse was found there.\u000a\u000aKogarashi doesn't think this is going to be a problem for him, and the rest of the house's tenants appear to be sexy women. While relaxing in the hot springs, though, he finds there is an issue with his ghost-banishing plan; Yuragi Manor's ghost is a 16-year-old girl named Yuna, who lives in his room. Kogarashi has no desire to hurt a ghost girl, and instead he ends up agreeing to help her to figure out her unfinished business. That way, she can move onto the afterlife before turning evil and falling into hell. Once it is clear that he is fine with Yuna, the other tenants reveal their own supernatural secrets\u2014his life in Yuragi Manor is going to be far from ordinary!\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

After giving a high school girl some ice cream, she returns the favor by promising to take care of Kouta while his father has gone on a business trip.

VChii and her husband are like any other happily married couple, except for one thing: Chii was assigned male at birth. Chii details her autobiographical account of growing up with gender dysphoria and ultimately deciding to transition in her early adult years. Shortly after Chii starts transitioning, she meets a man who is instantly enamored by her, and although he is surprised when Chii eventually tells him she used to live as a guy, he still wants to go out with her. As Chii continues to transition, her boyfriend supports her through the process, culminating in their marriage once her transition is complete.\u000a\u000a(Source: Hachimitsu Scans)

VThis is a story of a boy who challenges free diving.\u000a\u000a"Free diving (skin diving)" may remind you of the film "Le Grand Bleu". It is an extreme sport, and each meter added to its record brings us closer to the sea bed and further from the surface where one can breathe again. In this sense, free diving has a direct connection with death, with which our fight continues, refashioned over time, bit by bit. So, why would one free dive, and risk their life? The answer lies within "mysterious bond between the sea and human kind". And in the fast evolving world of competitive diving new data emerges that casts light on this bond.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VYamada is a castaway on an island without any ships passing by and he is unable to recall why he is there. After finding his sports bag, he assumes he was on a school trip. With only 7 days worth of food, he eventually decides to make a boat to leave the island. He thought he was alone on the island until finding a girl named Imaise Chika eating his food. They then decide to continue carving the boat together. Since the boat only has room for one, Yamada decides to set off for help, but returns upon noticing that not only has Imaise put her share of rations in his bag, they are mostly untouched as well. After returning, he notices she made the oar out of a fishing lance and he decides they can live on the island longer.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VThe story is set at Shishidou, a school attended by rich and elite people. Tom Shirasagi, a gambler, is a mysterious new transfer student who has come from a public school (instead of a prestigious private one) and faces the elitist environment. There, he declares a challenge toward any student and claims he will bring to the ruin the whole school through a series of gambling matches. Nobody knows why he has come to that school or what the real motivations behind his actions are.\u000a\u000aDuring any match, Tom shows off all of his unique coolness and ability.\u000a\u000aHe employs a wide range of tricks, both psychological and physical, to ensure his victory. In any game, you will constantly ask how he's planning to win, why he's really doing certain things, and what's really going on. At the end of the matches, the tricks are revealed, and they all work in real life, even if they do require one to be highly skilled or lucky in order to perform them.\u000a\u000aThe story centers around the various matches he undertakes and the interactions between the various characters, like Mika Shishidou, the beautiful granddaughter of the school headmaster, who is highly intelligent but contemptuous and superb, or Abidani, the vampiric looking dorm superintendent and main villain (for now) in the series, who has a sadistic personality and whose goal is to make Tom leave his school (or to get him killed).\u000a\u000aAs the story unfolds, more about Tom's past is revealed, leading to unpredictable turns of events.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VHundreds of years ago, horrifying creatures which resembled humans appeared. These mindless, towering giants, called "titans," proved to be an existential threat, as they preyed on whatever humans they could find in order to satisfy a seemingly unending appetite. Unable to effectively combat the titans, mankind was forced to barricade themselves within large walls surrounding what may very well be humanity's last safe haven in the world.\u000a\u000aIn the present day, life within the walls has finally found peace, since the residents have not dealt with titans for many years. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert are three young children who dream of experiencing all that the world has to offer, having grown up hearing stories of the wonders beyond the walls. But when the state of tranquility is suddenly shattered by the attack of a massive 60-meter titan, they quickly learn just how cruel the world can be. On that day, Eren makes a promise to himself that he will do whatever it takes to eradicate every single titan off the face of the Earth, with the hope that one day, humanity will once again be able to live outside the walls without fear.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VSeiya Toudouin's inability to answer one question has frustrated him to no end: "Why can't I get a girlfriend?" He gets the best grades, is fairly athletic, and, despite his modest opinion, is also rather good-looking. Even so, in all his 16 years of living, he has never once had a girlfriend. Every time he gets close to having one, he is left with bitter memories. Fed up with failures of the past, he sets a goal for himself\u2014to finally get a girlfriend during high school!\u000a\u000aYet what comes easily for others soon becomes a strenuous task for Seiya, whose inexperience and social awkwardness only make his struggle greater. Nevertheless, he resolves to soldier on no matter how low the odds, based on his sheer conviction that a girlfriend is what he truly needs. But as he moves forward, the journey itself might give him a greater reflection of himself than any mirror could.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

Yoshino and Mahiro were best friends, but one day Mahiro suddenly disappeared. Yoshino assumed that he found a clue to whoever murdered his family. Despite the close bond they had, Yoshino has no idea where Mahiro is. However, one day when Yoshino was putting flowers on Mahiros' family's grave, a woman questions Yoshino about Mahiro at gun point. According to the woman, Mahiro got involved with some serious issues that will inevitably put the human race in a catastrophic situation, and the Japanese government is desperately looking for Mahiro.

VRemember a time before cell phones could be found in every pocket? Or when even accessing the world wide web was something only readily available in a library? Back then letters still filled up postboxes and moments just felt so much more precious when captured on Polaroid film. Now life seems to move at the speed of light. Our memories are captured and shared with the world on social media platforms. And love, which is already capricious, can feel like it is moving at terminal velocity.\u000a\u000aIn Makoto Shinkai's defining work, the internationally renowned director and animator unfolds a love story that is as timeless as it is fleeting. Yukiko Seike's rendition of this modern classic adds a new level of emotion and intimacy that is unique to its source material.\u000a\u000a(Source: Vertical)

Confronting the governments of the world, a yellow tentacled monster boasts that it was the one responsible for the catastrophe, and in a year's time, it will do the same to Earth. Zooming around at Mach 20, the creature makes a peculiar demand: a teaching position at the prestigious Kunugigaoka Junior High School. Desperate to keep the creature in one place, the government agrees, and so the students of Class 3-E find themselves faced with an impossible task\u2014assassinate the creature responsible for destroying the moon.\u000a\u000aAlthough the fate of the world now rests on their shoulders, the class has more personal issues to deal with.

Despite their similarities, Yui hates how the other two are satisfied with their habits, and leaves quickly. Then alone, Parou expresses his support for Marika, causing her to fall in love with him.\u000a\u000aThough their meeting was cut short, the lives of these three people begin to cross.

Convinced his life is over, his despair turns into shock when he sees a woman jump out of a window of a nearby house. Tasuku races to the house in a panic only to discover that it's a public meeting lounge owned by the woman he saw before. Tasuku comes face to face with the woman as she walks past him unharmed, but not before she implies that she had been watching him from afar. Confused, Tasuku follows her up to the top of a steep hill where she offers to briefly listen to what's on his mind. Although Tasuku doesn't go into too much detail, he later accepts her invitation to come to the lounge to meet others with similar troubles.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VWolfsmund is a dark historical manga set in the early 14th century of Europe (Switzerland). The story revolves around the eponymous fortress in the St. Gotthard Pass which is ruled by a sadistic tyrant. Each chapter deals with characters who for some reason have to cross the pass and who end up getting interrogated by the tyrant.\u000a\u000aWhat sets this manga apart is the fact that there's rarely a happy ending for our protagonists. The author pulls no punches to show us just how brutal and inhuman the Middle Ages really were.\u000a\u000a(Source: Kotonoha)

He refuses to accept her apologies, and, to make matters worse, she discovers that he probably has a crush on their incredibly cute classmate Sumizome.\u000a\u000aShe has all these things in mind when she is summoned by Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami, a pale fox goddess. In return for rescuing a little fox-spirit creature before school that day, the goddess offers to grant a single wish of Inari's. Without thinking, she blurts out that she wants to be Sumizome. As one might expect, this wish does not go nearly as well as Inari had hoped, and the kindly goddess breaks a goddess-rule to give Inari the ability to change herself back. Now, Inari can change her own shape at will, and using her new skill is very tempting as she keeps trying to win Tanbabashi's heart. But if Inari flaunts her ability, both she and the goddess might end up in trouble with Amaterasu!\u000a\u000a(Source: MangaHelpers)

VHaving no experience in romance, the vibrant Ninako curiously explores the meaning of what "love" really is, and is surprised to feel a colorful range of emotions as she grows closer to the school heartthrob, the quiet yet gentle Ren, who also happens to be involved in a longtime relationship. With every intention of keeping her head held high, Ninako prepares to face the mental pain of this one-sided love that she had allowed to take root, facing a series of trials that would either contribute to her growth as a headstrong woman, or break her as it did with other girls.\u000a\u000aHowever, is this really a one-sided love? Or had something been silently sown in the most hidden part of Ren's heart?\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot:\u000aVolume 6: Colorless Dreamer

VHachiman Hikigaya, a student in Soubu High School, is a cynical loner due to his traumatic past experiences in his social life. This eventually led to him developing a set of "dead fish eyes" and a twisted personality similar to that of a petty criminal. Believing that the concept of youth is a lie made up by youngsters who face their failures in denial, he turns in an essay that criticizes this exact mentality of youths. Irritated by the submission, his homeroom teacher, Shizuka Hiratsuka forces him to join the Volunteer Service Club\u2014a club that assists students to solve their problems in life, hoping that helping other people would change his personality.\u000a\u000aHowever, Yukino Yukinoshita, the most beautiful girl in school, is surprisingly the sole member of the club and a loner, albeit colder and smarter than Hikigaya. Their club soon expands when Yui Yuigahama joins them after being helped with her plight, and they begin to accept more requests.\u000a\u000aWith his status quo as a recluse, Hikigaya attempts to solve problems in his own way, but his methods may prove to be a double-edged sword.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VThere's a serial killer loose in Los Angeles and the local authorities need help fast. For some reason the killer has been leaving a string of maddeningly arcane clues at each crime scene. Each of these clues, it seems, is an indecipherable roadmap to the next murder.\u000a\u000aOnto the scene comes L, the mysterious super-sleuth. Despite his peculiar working habits-he's never shown his face in public, for example-he's the most decorated detective in the world and has never tackled a case he hasn't been able to crack.\u000a\u000aBut this time he needs help.\u000a\u000aEnlisting the services of an FBI agent named Naomi Misora, L starts snooping around the City of Angels. It soon becomes apparent that the killing spree is a psychotic riddle designed to specifically engage L in a battle of wits. Stuck in the middle between killer and investigator, it's up to Misora to navigate both the dead bodies and the egos to solve the Los Angeles Murder Cases.\u000a\u000a(Source: VIZ Media)

Anyhow nothing is so simple: the motivations of the demon aren't so wicked as one could think and they will combine with the life of the boy which hangs between nightmare and craziness.\u000a\u000aIn the meanwhile the satanist will fight against the hierarchy of the church to obtain a justice which is, as it's easy to guess, that of the demon Maou.\u000a\u000aThis series didn't have an ending until it's remake in 2002.

VAmidst chants of "Heil Hitler," Germany's most celebrated leader, Adolf Hitler, addresses the nation. Under Hitler's leadership, the country has undergone monumental development, overcoming the humiliation of its World War I loss and growing into a fearsome military superpower. As Hitler addresses the growth of his nation, he reaffirms the importance of the German nationalistic spirit and warns against the arising Jewish threat. As he finishes his speech, Hitler raises his right arm in a final salute amidst the thundering roar of the crowd, having full confidence that he and his country will make their mark on history.\u000a\u000aGrowing up in a small town in Austria, Hitler was introduced to German nationalism at a young age. His parents had opposing views on his early interest in art\u2014harsh disapproval from his father and loving support from his mother. As a result, he was unfazed by the death of his father, yet utterly devastated by the death of his mother. Eventually, he applied to a fine arts school in Vienna, and to his frustration, was rejected immediately. This forced him to live on the streets, where he was was first exposed to antisemitism. Though skeptical at first, Hitler eventually adopts this ideology, soon transforming into a charismatic leader\u2014and an influential one who would shift the balance of power in the world and dramatically alter the course of history.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VUshio to Tora centers around the travails and battles of Ushio Aotsuki, who is constantly being stalked and aided by a gigantic, supernatural and sometimes invisible tiger-like monster.\u000a\u000aUshio's family maintains a Shinto temple in Japan, where ~500 years ago, his samurai ancestor battled that same tiger to a standstill, and eventually trapped him against a rock using a blessed spear called the "Beast Spear," which in addition to its intrinsic formidability as a weapon, can also endow its wielder with the martial ability of the ancestor who originally wielded it.\u000a\u000aUshio accidentally unsealed the cave Tora was trapped in. Initially, Ushio refuses to remove the spear pinning Tora down, but Tora's unsealed presence summons various monsters who wish to fight him, and by extension Ushio. Ushio is forced to free Tora, who would like to eat Ushio, but dares not since Ushio keeps the spear close by. The series focuses on their relationship, interspersed with battles against mythological foes, and with Tora's attempts to grapple with modern life.\u000a\u000a(Source: Wikipedia)

VUnder the threat of being disowned, Mafuyu Kurosaki\u2014an ex-delinquent with a strong sense of justice, exceptional fighting skills, and a very dense head\u2014has to start a new life as a proper citizen and student at Midorigaoka Academy. Apart from adapting to a new school, Mafuyu also has to get used to living alone as the dorms are full. Therefore, she starts a new chapter in her life with limited funds, the inability to make even a cup of instant noodles, and a big dream of becoming "an ultra-shiny female high school student."\u000a\u000aThis dream, however, is quite hard to fulfill since Mafuyu's sense of style is uncouth, and troubles tend to find her no matter how hard she tries to avoid them. The path to her dreams is made more difficult because of Takaomi Saeki, her unordinary homeroom teacher with barely legal teaching methods, and her delinquent classmate Kaori Hayasaka, who becomes her first new friend.\u000a\u000aOresama Teacher follows Mafuyu's adventure full of hilarious situations, ridiculous misunderstandings, and exciting action sequences, all while she still tries to become a normal feminine girl.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

Imagine Breaker can defeat any other power, but it also undermines Kamijou's own good luck. His Imagine Breaker's immense strength is literally immeasurable, so hapless Kamijou is listed at the supernatural level of 0. He happens to meet a girl in white hanging off his window balcony. The girl says she is being chased by sorcerers, and Kamijou learns that the girl is a Church of England nun whose memories have been forcibly replaced by Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum \u2014 the 103,000 forbidden texts of the Church.\u000a\u000a(Source: MU)

VThirty years ahead of the rest of the world scientifically and home to millions of students enrolled in the esper development program, Academy City never sees a dull moment. Here, espers are given one of five power levels, the highest of which consists of only seven members. Mikoto Misaka, a middle school electromaster, ranks third among these individuals, and is known as "The Railgun."\u000a\u000aIn a city known for housing extraordinary individuals, it comes as no surprise that extraordinary things tend to happen. Recently, makeshift bombs disguised as everyday objects have been ominously finding their way into public areas. Mikoto's best friend, Kuroko Shirai, has been investigating the case as a member of the student-based disciplinary committee Judgement. As more and more of these incidents come to light, it becomes apparent that a hidden darkness exists within Academy City, one that may not only impact Mikoto and her friends, but also the fate of the city itself.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VIn stories of people who swap bodies, they always return to their rightful places. But what if that never happens? Unfortunately, this is the exact predicament Yui Ootsuka and Yuuta Kimura find themselves in.\u000a\u000aOne day, after Yuuta comes crashing down on Yui from the treetops, both children find themselves in an unfamiliar body. But no matter how desperately they try, they are unable to revert things to how they originally were.

In this wearisome situation, the two of them discover what it truly means to walk in someone else's shoes.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]

VMoe is a gorgeous high school student whom others find difficult to get along with, as her blunt honesty often comes off as insensitive. However, after meeting Eiko Sakamoto, a plain but exceedingly gracious girl, Moe feels she has finally found someone who truly understands her. Ever since then, the two have been inseparable best friends.\u000a\u000aBecause Eiko has an exceptionally kind heart, Moe takes it upon herself to protect her because of how much she cherishes their friendship. With guys often asking her out, she immediately lays down a single rule: dating her means they must also spend quality time with Eiko. Though the affections of others may push them apart, the two girls refuse to falter and show just how deep their bond truly is.\u000a\u000a[Written by MAL Rewrite]\u000a\u000aIncluded one-shot: Sono Kare, Shirabemasu
