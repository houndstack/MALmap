Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ", "Image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/11/12936.jpg"}, "y": 309.525390625, "x": 610.7981567382812, "id": "2608", "size": 1.8240952491760254}, {"color": "rgb(143,105,26)", "label": "HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun suru", "attributes": {"Score": 6.47, "Rank": "#5526", "Popularity": "#1189", "Members": "56,373", "Episodes": 12, "Season": "Winter 2016", "Genres": "Music, Slice of Life, Mystery, Romance, School", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/30895\">HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun suru</a>", "Synopsis": "Chika Homura begins her high school career with a goal: to develop a \"cute girl\" persona.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "Image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/8/13994.jpg"}, "y": 380.86407470703125, "x": -95.40081024169922, "id": "5226", "size": 2.1406497955322266}, {"color": "rgb(154,127,255)", "label": "Full Metal Panic!", "attributes": {"Score": 7.78, "Rank": "#898", "Popularity": "#159", "Members": "280,524", "Episodes": 24, "Season": "Winter 2002", "Genres": "Action, Military, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Mecha", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/71\">Full Metal Panic!</a>", "Synopsis": "Equipped with cutting-edge weaponry and specialized troops, a private military organization named Mithril strives to extinguish the world's terrorism and all threats to peace on earth.

While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth's natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity's main line of defense against the Neuroi.\n\r\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well.

Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\r\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\r\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\r\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Phidias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\r\nThe Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\r\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\r\n(Source: AniDB) ", "Image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/10/17471.jpg"}, "y": -10.179911613464355, "x": -183.21778869628906, "id": "7193", "size": 2.563157796859741}, {"color": "rgb(143,105,26)", "label": "Dantalian no Shoka", "attributes": {"Score": 7.33, "Rank": "#2228", "Popularity": "#766", "Members": "92,979", "Episodes": 12, "Season": "Summer 2011", "Genres": "Action, Mystery, Historical, Supernatural", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/8915\">Dantalian no Shoka</a>", "Synopsis": "Six months ago, Lord Hugh Anthony Disward, also known as Huey, lost his eccentric grandfather, Sir Wesley Disward, who was a renowned collector of rare books.
