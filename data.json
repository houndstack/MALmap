One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/13994.jpg"}, "y": 175.88624572753906, "x": -267.6628112792969, "id": "5226", "size": 2.073082447052002}, {"color": "rgb(255,184,237)", "label": "Nagi no Asu kara", "attributes": {"Score": 8.19, "Rank": "#320", "Popularity": "#224", "Members": "376,931", "Episodes": 26, "Season": "Fall 2013", "Genres": "Drama, Fantasy, Romance", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/16067\">Nagi no Asu kara</a>", "Synopsis": "Long ago, all humans lived beneath the sea.

With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12936.jpg"}, "y": -316.7386779785156, "x": -153.42666625976562, "id": "2608", "size": 1.774139642715454}, {"color": "rgb(211,205,255)", "label": "Ikkitousen", "attributes": {"Score": 6.53, "Rank": "#5924", "Popularity": "#934", "Members": "117,654", "Episodes": 13, "Season": "Summer 2003", "Genres": "Ecchi, Super Power, Martial Arts, School", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/257\">Ikkitousen</a>", "Synopsis": "In Ikkitousen, the Kanto region of Japan is locked in the middle of a turf war between seven different high schools.

Melromarc is a country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have repeatedly ravaged the land and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are respectively bestowed a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves. Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku, becomes cursed with the fate of being the \"Shield Hero.\" Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality.\n\r\nWhen the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, Malty Melromarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely accused of taking advantage of her. Naofumi then becomes heavily discriminated against and hated by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm of hurt and mistrust in his heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening himself and his reputation. Further along however, the difficulty of being on his own sets in, so Naofumi buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named Raphtalia to accompany him on his travels.\n\r\nAs the Waves approach the kingdom, Naofumi and Raphtalia must fight for the survival of the kingdom and protect the people of Melromarc from their ill-fated future.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1490/101365.jpg"}, "y": 79.90696716308594, "x": -247.6033172607422, "id": "35790", "size": 3.097414255142212}, {"color": "rgb(255,173,198)", "label": "Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka", "attributes": {"Score": 6.86, "Rank": "#4324", "Popularity": "#3864", "Members": "12,740", "Episodes": 12, "Season": "Winter 2003", "Genres": "Drama, Mecha, Military, Romance, Sci-Fi, Shounen, Slice of Life", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/266\">Gunparade March: Arata Naru Kougunka</a>", "Synopsis": "It began in 1945, at the end of the Pacific War.

Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression, and drugs that taints his life for years.

The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei.\" It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Phidias. The most prominent theme of Run, Melos! is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\nThe Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out\u2014if he can.\n\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\r\n(Source: AniDB)", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/17471.jpg"}, "y": 190.38714599609375, "x": -114.71123504638672, "id": "7193", "size": 2.7636609077453613}, {"color": "rgb(68,239,233)", "label": "Teekyuu", "attributes": {"Score": 6.66, "Rank": "#5299", "Popularity": "#1897", "Members": "48,758", "Episodes": 12, "Season": "Fall 2012", "Genres": "Comedy, School, Shounen, Sports", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15125\">Teekyuu</a>", "Synopsis": "Teekyuu is all about the wacky antics of four schoolgirls\u2014Kanae Shinjou gets bored easily and often breaks the laws of physics to get what she wants; Nasuno Takamiya is incredibly rich and knows how to make things go her way; Marimo Bandou would probably get arrested from her actions like eating panties or kidnapping children; and Yuri Oshimoto, their ordinary junior, rounds out the eccentric bunch that forms the sole members of their school's tennis club. \n\r\nDespite their interest in learning the sport, the older girls prefer messing around, while Yuri, being the only one who actually knows how to play and the most mature in spite of being younger, has to deal with her seniors' out of control behavior. \n\r\nWhen these four girls come together, insanity ensues in this lightning-paced comedy about a tennis club that doesn't really play tennis. \n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/56463.jpg"}, "y": 7.938693523406982, "x": 186.61485290527344, "id": "15125", "size": 2.473836660385132}, {"color": "rgb(155,214,211)", "label": "Lupin the Third: Mine Fujiko to Iu Onna", "attributes": {"Score": 7.81, "Rank": "#894", "Popularity": "#2172", "Members": "39,581", "Episodes": 13, "Season": "Spring 2012", "Genres": "Action, Adventure, Comedy, Ecchi, Samurai, Seinen", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/13203\">Lupin the Third: Mine Fujiko to Iu Onna</a>", "Synopsis": "Many people are falling prey to a suspicious new religion.
