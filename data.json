Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/12936.jpg"}, "color": "rgb(154,213,172)", "size": 1.7691400051116943}, {"label": "Mahou Shoujo Ore", "x": -40.525455474853516, "y": -223.75411987304688, "id": "36902", "attributes": {"Score": 6.66, "Rank": "#5066", "Popularity": "#1739", "Members": "60,207", "Episodes": 12, "Season": "Spring 2018", "Genres": "Comedy, Fantasy, Magic", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/\"36902\">Mahou Shoujo Ore</a>", "Synopsis": "Saki Uno is an average 15-year-old girl with a side hustle as a member of the exceptionally unpopular idol duo Magical Twins.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/13994.jpg"}, "color": "rgb(255,204,255)", "size": 2.06630802154541}, {"label": "Shinigami no Ballad.", "x": 61.1333122253418, "y": 68.33050537109375, "id": "789", "attributes": {"Score": 6.95, "Rank": "#3827", "Popularity": "#2288", "Members": "39,493", "Episodes": 6, "Season": "Spring 2006", "Genres": "Drama, Fantasy, Psychological, Supernatural", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/\"789\">Shinigami no Ballad.</a>", "Synopsis": "A girl wrapped in white, her name is Momo...in her hand lies a blunt yet shiny scythe.

But the 666th squadron finds itself with more enemies than just the alien forces when optimistic rookie Katia Waldheim joins the squadron, drawing the attention of East Germany's secret police, the Stasi.\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "Image": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/77386.jpg"}, "color": "rgb(127,236,159)", "size": 1.0}, {"label": "Gamers!", "x": 130.3101043701172, "y": -199.72117614746094, "id": "34280", "attributes": {"Score": 7.07, "Rank": "#3341", "Popularity": "#290", "Members": "349,136", "Episodes": 12, "Season": "Summer 2017", "Genres": "Comedy, Romance, School", "MAL Link": "<a href=\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/\"34280\">Gamers!</a>", "Synopsis": "Keita Amano is a typical high school gamer living out an average student's life.

It is in this city that Van meets Wendy Garret, a timid young girl who is looking for her kidnapped brother. When the city pleads for Van's assistance to defend it, he refuses, claiming it has nothing to do with him and thus leaves the city on its own to deal with the peril. Soon after, Van comes across the raiding bandits himself and they eventually tick off the swordsman to a degree where he takes action against them for his own personal vendetta.
