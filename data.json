That couldn\u0027t be further from the truth for Shuurei Kou. Despite the Kou family being an old and important bloodline, they\u0027ve fallen on hard times. Shuurei\u0027s father works as an archivist in the Imperial library, which is a prestigious position, but unfortunately not one that pays much. To put food on the table, Shuurei works odd jobs such as teaching young children or playing live music in a restaurant―and even then, it\u0027s barely enough.\n\r\nThen, one day, a court advisor makes Shuurei an offer. If she becomes the concubine of the new, but lazy, emperor and teaches him how to become a good ruler, then she will receive 500 pieces of gold. Never one to turn down good money, Shuurei accepts the proposition. After all, the new emperor only prefers men so her virtue is safe… or so she thinks. \n\r\nThe more time she spends in the palace, the more her old dream of becoming a court official is reignited. There\u0027s only one problem: she\u0027s a woman and women do not become government officials. Shuurei may be able to turn the emperor into a good ruler, but will it be at the expense of her own aspirations?","Members":"55966","Link":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/957\"\u003eSaiunkoku Monogatari\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(190,134,0)","size":3.10953950881958},{"label":"Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi","x":30.753313064575195,"y":312.7154541015625,"id":"1210","attributes":{"Score":"7.5","Popularity":"#471","Episodes":"12","Rank":"#1578","Genres":"Fantasy, Mystery","Season":"Summer 2013","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/2/52127.jpg","Synopsis":"God has abandoned the world.

Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\r\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\r\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man\u0027s life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki\u0027s previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\r\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Phidias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend\u0027s life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\r\nThe Spider\u0027s Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\r\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord\u0027s staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\r\n(Source: AniDB) ","Members":"105229","Link":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7193\"\u003eAoi Bungaku Series\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(0,153,253)","size":2.563157796859741},{"label":"Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory","x":-1356.1927490234375,"y":1386.763916015625,"id":"52","attributes":{"Score":"7.44","Popularity":"#2218","Episodes":"13","Rank":"#1824","Genres":"Military, Sci-Fi, Adventure, Space, Drama, Mecha","Season":"","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/13/26654.jpg","Synopsis":"It is the year 0083 of the Universal Century.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu\u0027s Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei\u0027s Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao\u0027s perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Members":"11268","Link":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5226\"\u003eSouten Kouro\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(190,134,0)","size":2.1406497955322266},{"label":"Makai Senki Disgaea","x":-844.8662109375,"y":-279.5208435058594,"id":"391","attributes":{"Score":"6.88","Popularity":"#1782","Episodes":"12","Rank":"#3887","Genres":"Action, Comedy, Demons, Fantasy, Magic","Season":"Spring 2006","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/5/11816.jpg","Synopsis":"An angel arrives in Hell!

Alien invaders known as the Neuroi came to Earth in 1939. This is not the first appearance of the Neuroi as they have appeared at seemingly random intervals throughout human history. While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth\u0027s natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity\u0027s main line of defense against the Neuroi.\n\r\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person. The series follows the battles fought by the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, who battle on the front lines to defend the British Isles from the Neuroi. Will humanity be able to take back Earth and bring peace to their home? Find out in Strike Witches!","Members":"105285","Link":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3667\"\u003eStrike
