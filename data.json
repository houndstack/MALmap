Of course, there\u0027s also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car\u0027s previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner\u0027s death. The manga follows Akio\u0027s various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ","Members":"11839","URL":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12677\"\u003eWangan Midnight\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(198,124,0)","size":1.5253827571868896},{"label":"Kyoto Animation: Suiei-hen","x":1505.0946044921875,"y":936.7822265625,"id":"745","attributes":{"Score":"7.21","Popularity":"3417","Episodes":"1","Rank":"2684","Genres":"Sports","Season":"","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/4/51881.jpg","Synopsis":"Kyoto Animation commercial that aired during episode 10 of Tamako Market.","Members":"9113","URL":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12677\"\u003eKyoto Animation: Suiei-hen\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(0,175,134)","size":1.0},{"label":"Demi-chan wa Kataritai","x":405.4626159667969,"y":-1915.283935546875,"id":"670","attributes":{"Score":"7.81","Popularity":"501","Episodes":"12","Rank":"839","Genres":"Comedy, Fantasy, School, Seinen","Season":"Winter 2017","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/8/83417.jpg","Synopsis":"High school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi may look like your average everyday instructor, but beneath his gentle appearance lies something less ordinary: his fascination for the \"Ajin,\" more commonly known as \"Demi.\" Although these half-human, half-monster beings have integrated into human society, Takahashi believes that much about them will remain unknown unless he interacts with them firsthand.\n\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai follows Takahashi\u0027s daily life in Shibasaki High School together with his three Demi students—Hikari Takanashi, an energetic vampire; Kyouko Machi, a gentle dullahan; and Yuki Kusakabe, the shy snow woman.

While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth\u0027s natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity\u0027s main line of defense against the Neuroi.\n\r\nWith normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person.

Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.\n\r\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.\n\r\nKokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man\u0027s life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls \"Sensei\". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki\u0027s previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.\n\r\nRun, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Phidias. The most prominent theme of \"Run, Melos!\" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend\u0027s life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.\n\r\nThe Spider\u0027s Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.\n\r\nHell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the \"Buddhist Hell.\" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord\u0027s staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household, as the story descends into madness and destruction.\n\r\n(Source: AniDB) ","Members":"105211","URL":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12677\"\u003eAoi Bungaku Series\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(47,120,160)","size":2.505711317062378},{"label":"Hakuouki Reimeiroku","x":-2189.950439453125,"y":-1429.1339111328125,"id":"1571","attributes":{"Score":"7.62","Popularity":"1742","Episodes":"12","Rank":"1249","Genres":"Action, Historical, Supernatural, Drama, Samurai, Josei","Season":"Summer 2012","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/11/71798.jpg","Synopsis":"The year is 1863 and as Japan\u0027s long festering wounds of political discord erupt into violent waves of street clashes and murder, the Tokugawa Shogunate sends a new force of masterless samurai called the Roshigumi to the aid of the Aizu forces in Kyoto.

Unfortunately things don\u0027t go as swimmingly as one would hope, as one of the soldiers, Kei Agemaki, is terribly afraid of youkai and one of the spirits, Zakuro, has an extreme dislike for humans who accept practices and traditions from the west. Life for these two is about to become a lot more interesting as they have to learn how to cooperate with their worst enemies!","Members":"68784","URL":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12677\"\u003eOtome Youkai Zakuro\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(129,160,0)","size":2.6797051429748535},{"label":"Kaitou Joker","x":-1861.30908203125,"y":-1827.620361328125,"id":"1542","attributes":{"Score":"6.94","Popularity":"3782","Episodes":"13","Rank":"3678","Genres":"Adventure, Comedy, Mystery, Shounen","Season":"Fall 2014","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/12/64975.jpg","Synopsis":"In the story, there is nothing in the world that the mysterious phantom thief Joker cannot steal.

Due to the fact that pollution was becoming a major problem, scientists had developed the use of hydrogen fuel called \"HBT\" as an alternative to fossil fuels. At this time humans have colonized Mars in search of new place to call home as a result of overpopulation. In the year 2050, a mysterious alien race called the Inbit invaded the Earth. Unable to fight the Inbits, Earth became desolate with only a few pockets of human beings scattered throughout the planet. Many of the refugees escape aboard a few remaining shuttles to seek shelter on the Moon. The Inbit sets up their main base of operations in the Great Lakes area of North America called \"Reflex Point\".\n\n However, the Mars colony, dubbed the Mars Base, did not forget about the plight of Earth. Troops were sent in to fight the Inbits from the Moon, only to fail miserably. The Inbits did not attack Mars, and showed no interest towards the other planets. Surprisingly the Inbit show no hostility towards humans unless they are directly provoked. The Inbit can also sense the presence of HBT, and use of the fuel is limited under their supervision, as HBT is a common component in weapons technology. Overnight the Mars base becomes a gigantic military machine, producing vast amounts of advanced weaponry and trained troops. In 2080, Mars Base sent in the next wave of troops. Although equipped with more technologically advanced equipment and transformable mecha, the attempt to recapture the homeworld was nonetheless a failure.\n\nThree years later, Mars Base launched another attack called the Second Earth Recapture Force. One of the troops happened to be Lieutenant Stick Bernard (Also called Stig Bernard by some, the original english dub before Robotech used Stick). The mission proved to be unsuccessful as it did three years ago and Stick\u0027s fiancée Marlene was killed. After losing her, Stick was forced to crash into Earth, landing in South America. At first, he was sorrowful and depressed at the death of his beloved Marlene. After seeing the holographic recording of his dead betrothed, Stick swore an oath of vengeance. In his quest to reach the Reflex Point on North America, the Inbit \u0027hive\u0027, he meets other characters of the show, forming a group of ragtag freedom fighters on a goal to rid the planet of the Inbits.\n\nAs the plot unravels, the purpose of the Inbits invasion is revealed. Their sole purpose of coming to the planet was because Earth provides them a suitable place to evolve into more complex beings. However, little did the Inbits know that their endeavor actually threatens to cause the extinction of both humans and Inbits. And thus, it is up to Stick and his group, with the help of human-like Inbits (Aisha and Solzie), to convince the supreme ruler of the Inbit, the Refles, to flee from Earth.\nMOSPEADA stands for Military Operation Soldier Protect Emergency Aviation Dive Auto, one of the transformable motorcycle-armors the series features. The other primary mecha featured in the show is the three-form transformable fighter called the Armo-Fighter AFC-01 Legioss, which is very much similar to the VF-1 Valkyrie variable fighter in The Super Dimension Fortress Macross.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\n\n","Members":"4807","URL":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12677\"\u003eKikou Souseiki Mospeada\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(176,90,52)","size":1.0},{"label":"Takarajima","x":-2397.220947265625,"y":-788.890380859375,"id":"1147","attributes":{"Score":"8.02","Popularity":"3941","Episodes":"26","Rank":"523","Genres":"Adventure, Mystery, Historical, Drama","Season":"Fall 1978","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/11/56123.jpg","Synopsis":"Jim Hawkins is a young boy lead by progressive events to embark on a search journey for the legendary treasure of the once dreaded pirate, Captain Flint.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu\u0027s Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei\u0027s Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao\u0027s perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)","Members":"11267","URL":"\u003ca href\u003d\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12677\"\u003eSouten Kouro\u003c/a\u003e"},"color":"rgb(129,160,0)","size":1.8813856840133667},{"label":"Tetsuwan Birdy Decode:02","x":-436.87640380859375,"y":1943.162353515625,"id":"1597","attributes":{"Score":"7.82","Popularity":"1781","Episodes":"12","Rank":"833","Genres":"Action, Sci-Fi, Comedy","Season":"Winter 2009","Image":"https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/10/53907.jpg","Synopsis":"Following the Ryunka disaster, Tokyo is left in a period of social turmoil.
